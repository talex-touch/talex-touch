/**
 * Stops the drizzle snapshot chain drifting further from the journal (#1303).
 *
 * `drizzle-kit` diffs against the newest snapshot. The newest here is `0014`, written
 * 2025-12-10, while the journal runs to `0037` — so `db:generate`'s first output re-emits
 * every change from the 23 migrations in between, and cannot be committed.
 *
 * Repairing that is a migration-history decision (rebuild each intermediate state, or flatten
 * to a new baseline) and belongs to the maintainer. What does not need a decision is that the
 * gap should not get *bigger* while it waits: every hand-written migration added today widens
 * it silently, and the only symptom is that the generator stays unusable.
 *
 * So this pins the known gap and fails when it grows. It is a ratchet, not a fix: the number
 * below is a debt, and lowering it is the repair.

/**
 * Journal indexes with no snapshot, as of 2026-08-11.
 *
 * `0011` and `0012` are not a later deletion — `git log --diff-filter=A` finds no commit that
 * ever added them, and `--diff-filter=D` finds no snapshot deletion at all. The chain was
 * never complete, so there is no lost history to recover before deciding what to do.
 *
 * Raised 24 → 25 on 2026-08-13, deliberately, which is the escape hatch this check offers rather
 * than a way around it. Both `master` and `app-shell-v2` had added a migration numbered `0037`;
 * merging them meant keeping both, so `0037_conversation_messages_composite_pk` was renumbered to
 * `0038`. `app-shell-v2` never carried a snapshot for it — its `meta/` stops at `0014` — so the
 * renumber did not lose one, it moved a gap that already existed.
 *
 * The right repair is `db:generate` against the merged schema, which rebuilds the chain rather
 * than shifting the pin again. That is a separate change: doing it inside a 38-file merge would
 * mix a schema-tooling run with conflict resolutions nobody could review apart.
 *
 * Raised 25 → 28 through 2026-08-28 for the hand-written, upgrade-safe
 * `0039_conversation_sync_tombstones`, `0040_conversation_sync_state_migration`, and
 * `0041_ai_orchestrator_run_retention` migrations in the intentionally snapshotless 0015+ range.
 * This records the three known additions explicitly without pretending the broken snapshot chain
 * has been repaired.
 *
 * Raised 28 → 30 on 2026-09-08 for the hand-written voice insight and detailed recognition
 * record migrations `0042` and `0043`; the snapshot chain remains intentionally untouched.
 *
 * Raised 30 → 31 on 2026-09-09 for `0044_clipboard_retention_expiry`, the hand-written
 * upgrade that adds the expiry column already used by clipboard capture. Its full-chain
 * SQLite regression is in clipboard-retention-expiry-schema.test.ts. This records only
 * that migration's known gap; it does not regenerate or claim to repair snapshot history.
 *
 * Raised 31 → 32 on 2026-09-11 for `0045_voice_polish_telemetry`, the hand-written upgrade that
 * adds the content-free tidy-up telemetry table. Its full-chain SQLite regression is in
 * voice-polish-telemetry-schema.test.ts. This records only that migration's known gap; it does
 * not regenerate or claim to repair snapshot history.
 *
 * Raised 32 → 33 on 2026-09-13 for `0046_voice_provider_entries`, the hand-written upgrade that
 * adds the voice provider catalog pack table. Its full-chain SQLite regression is in
 * voice-provider-entries-schema.test.ts. This records only that migration's known gap; it does
 * not regenerate or claim to repair snapshot history.
 *
 * Raised 33 → 35 on 2026-09-15 while merging `pi-desktop-analysis`, for its two hand-written
 * migrations. Both collided at `0046` with master's `0046_voice_provider_entries` and were
 * renumbered on merge — `0046_folder_projects_native_sessions` → `0047`, and
 * `0047_home_pi_native_sessions` → `0048` — the same renumber-on-merge precedent as the
 * 24 → 25 raise above, which moved an existing gap rather than losing a snapshot. Their
 * full-chain SQLite regressions are in project-native-sessions-schema.test.ts and the Local
 * AI CLI continuation suite. This records the two known additions; it does not regenerate or
 * claim to repair snapshot history.
 *
 * Raised 35 → 36 on 2026-09-21 for `0049_voice_provider_latency`, the hand-written upgrade that
 * adds the provider round-trip column beside the end-to-end recognition duration. Both homes that
 * create the table are pinned by voice-recognition-records-schema.test.ts. This records only that
 * migration's known gap; it does not regenerate or claim to repair snapshot history.
 *
 * Raised 36 → 37 on 2026-09-26 for `0050_voice_recognition_location`, the hand-written
 * upgrade that records whether each attempt actually ran in the cloud or on-device. Primary and
 * auxiliary homes, including existing-profile ALTER paths, are pinned by
 * voice-recognition-records-schema.test.ts. This records only the known gap.
 *
 * Raised 37 → 38 on 2026-09-29 for `0051_usage_execute_events`, the hand-written upgrade that adds
 * the event-id dedupe table and the `usage_logs.event_id` column behind accepted execution
 * counting. Both homes that create the tables — the migration chain and the aux `ensureAuxTables`
 * DDL plus its guarded ALTER — are pinned by usage-execute-events-schema.test.ts. This records
 * only the known gap; it does not regenerate or claim to repair snapshot history.
 *
 * Raised 38 → 39 on 2026-10-05 for the accepted PI workspace migration
 * `0052_conversation_workspaces`: its queue, receipts, attachments and review tables follow the
 * documented hand-written 0015+ policy. Its journal timestamp is the new maximum; the
 * existing-profile migration and aux DDL are covered by the workspace storage contracts.
 * This records that one known addition, not a repaired or regenerated snapshot chain.
 *
 * Raised 39 → 40 on 2026-10-05 for `0053_search_index_document_locators`, the hand-written
 * upgrade that adds nullable FTS rowid/document hashes and durable maintenance cursors to
 * both primary and search homes through their shared migration chain. This records only
 * that migration's known gap; it does not regenerate or repair historical snapshots.
 *
 * Raised 40 → 42 on 2026-10-22 for two hand-written migrations that reached master without
 * raising it: `0054_app_foreground_activity` (2026-10-07), the table of each app's latest
 * frontmost instant, and `0055_search_keyword_postings` (2026-10-21), the size-capped keyword
 * postings and `search_index_meta.doc_id`. index.search-schema.test.ts takes a search home from
 * the pre-0055 chain through 0055; 0054 is a plain CREATE IF NOT EXISTS with no dedicated chain
 * test. This records those two known additions; it does not regenerate or repair historical
 * snapshots.
