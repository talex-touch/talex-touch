 * credential and no endpoint here — only a model bundle on disk, a binary able to
 * execute it, and the audio the user just spoke. Everything that a remote provider
 * gets from the network has to be supplied locally instead, which is why the
 * descriptor carries the facts the runtime would otherwise discover at runtime:
 * which engine executes the weights, what the weights are expected to hash to, and
 * which systematic defects of the model the caller must compensate for.

 * nonsense. Every family below was measured on this project's benchmark before being listed
 * (AISHELL-1 and dictation-shaped TTS, see `asr-arena`), and all of them are offline models —
 * the streaming encoders are deliberately absent, because this runtime spawns one process per
