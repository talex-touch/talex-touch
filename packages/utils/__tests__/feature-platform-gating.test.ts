/**
 * A manifest's `feature.platform` declaration has to actually gate registration (#820).
 *
 * Every shipped manifest writes `{ win32, darwin, linux }` booleans, and for a long time
 * nothing read them: features declared themselves unavailable on a platform and registered
 * there anyway. They avoided misbehaving only because each prelude re-checks
 * `process.platform` on its own, so the user saw the feature, triggered it, and was told it
 * was unsupported.
 *
 * Two things can silently undo that, and they need different guards:
 *
 * - the gate is dropped from the loader — covered by the loader's own unit tests
 * - the *declarations* change, so the gate stops covering the features it was written for —
 *   covered here, against the real manifests
 *
 * Lives in `packages/utils` because `ci / CI - utils` blocks a PR, whereas
 * `App suites (core-app)` is continue-on-error and reports success whatever the suite does.
