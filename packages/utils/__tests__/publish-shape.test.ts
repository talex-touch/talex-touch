/**
 * The published package must be loadable by Node (#566).
 *
 * @talex-touch/utils is public, and its entry was `index.ts` — a raw TypeScript barrel whose
 * re-exports are extensionless directory specifiers. Node 24 strips the types, reparses as ESM and
 * then cannot resolve `./account`, so `import '@talex-touch/utils'` failed outright with
 * ERR_UNSUPPORTED_DIR_IMPORT. Only the in-repo Vite aliases hid it.
 *
 * The fix publishes a bundle. What is worth pinning is not that decision but the three things
 * measured along the way, each of which looks like an improvement and is not:
 *
 * 1. Publishing TypeScript can never work, whatever the specifiers say. Even with `./account/index.ts`
 *    written out in full, Node refuses: ERR_UNSUPPORTED_NODE_MODULES_TYPE_STRIPPING. And adding those
 *    extensions in source breaks the core-app typecheck, which has no allowImportingTsExtensions.
 * 2. An `exports` map is the usual advice and would be a serious regression here. Subpath patterns
 *    resolve to exact files: neither Node nor esbuild falls through a fallback array when the first
 *    target is merely missing. Mapping the wildcard to itself breaks every deep import, and a
 *    fallback of star-dot-ts then star-slash-index-dot-ts breaks the directory half — measured
 *    against 144 in-repo subpaths. With no exports map, classic resolution keeps them all working
 *    exactly as before.
 * 3. `main` has to be the ESM output. Pointed at the CJS build, `import` goes through
 *    cjs-module-lexer and yields 2 named exports instead of 610; pointed at `.mjs`, `require()`
 *    still works because Node ≥22.12 can require ESM, and engines already demands ≥24.15.
