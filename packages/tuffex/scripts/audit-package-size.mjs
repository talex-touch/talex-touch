// Ratchets, not targets. The 16/330 pair was set on 2026-06-05 against 107 components; there are
// now 126, and nothing re-measured them since. They were also never enforced -- no workflow ran
// this script at all -- so they protected nothing while drifting out of date.
//
// These are today's sizes plus a little headroom, which is the smallest change that makes the gate
// mean something: growth from here fails, and lowering them later is a one-line edit. It is not an
// endorsement of the current figures. Whether the CSS itself should shrink is open on #1555, along
// with the measurement behind it: base.css is 14.9 KiB of design tokens (102 `--tx-*` vars) and
// carries only 0.2 KiB of component styles, so it is not leaking -- it simply outgrew a two-month
// -old number.
const LIMITS = {
  // 32 -> 40 on 2026-08-15 for the Beautiful UI port (retired task 08-15-beautiful-ui-port):
  // base.css gains the `--tx-bui-*` token layer (33 tokens x 2 themes + shadow/radius/mono
  // entries, ~2.7 KiB) against 2.4 KiB of headroom. Re-measure and trim the slack once the
  // BUI component family lands.
  baseCssBytes: 40 * 1024,
  // 448 -> 488 and 64 -> 96 on 2026-08-13, re-baselined for the app-shell-v2 convergence (#1742):
  // CI measured full CSS at 481.6 KiB and stream-markdown at 92.0 KiB after that branch's
  // conversation/markdown product styles landed. Same contract as the note above -- today's size
  // plus minimal headroom, growth from here fails, and #1555 still owns whether it should shrink.
  // 488 -> 640 on 2026-08-15: the Beautiful UI port adds 24 component directories. Measured
  // 623.8 KiB after the full family landed (the BUI styles run well above the old 2.8 KiB
  // median — pixel-matched surfaces are style-heavy), so this is actuals plus minimal
  // headroom, same contract as the notes above: growth from here fails.
  // 640 -> 656 on 2026-08-31: the 16.2 KiB of headroom left in August was already spent —
  // master measured 639.8 KiB against the 640 limit, so any style change at all failed the
  // gate, not just a large one. Switch loading (breathing fill, travelling border line) and
  // the slider's dissolve add 4.8 KiB on top, measured at 644.6 KiB. Same contract as every
  // note above: actuals plus minimal headroom, growth from here fails, and #1555 still owns
  // whether the total should be coming down instead.
  // 656 -> 664 on 2026-09-07: three surfaces grew at once — the date picker gained month and
  // year quick-switch grids, a range band with its own end/middle geometry and direction-aware
  // step transitions (+4.3 KiB, after moving its style block to SCSS so its comments stop
  // shipping, which gave 1.4 KiB back); the cascader split into per-level anchored panels with
  // their own row and level styles (+0.1 KiB net, the old column layout came out); and card-item
  // gained the hover-over-active rule. Measured 660.8 KiB. Same contract as every note above:
  // actuals plus minimal headroom, growth from here fails.
  // 664 -> 552 on 2026-09-07: CSS is now minified on the way out (`cssMinify`,
  // with the JS deliberately left readable), which took the same stylesheets
  // from 663.5 KiB to 541.2. Re-baselined against the smaller artifact so the
  // saving cannot be quietly spent.
  //
  // Note what this number is and is not. `components.css` is the full-import
  // entry, which nothing in this repo loads: both apps import `base.css` plus
  // per-component stylesheets. It is a ceiling on the library's total surface,
  // not a measure of what any page downloads — `onDemandCssBytes` below is the
  // one that tracks a real cost.
  // 552 -> 560 on 2026-09-12: the vendored GitHub markdown sheet is now scoped
  // (`:where(.tx-md) ` on each of its 314 selectors) because, imported as a
  // global stylesheet, its `.markdown-body` rules were landing on any host page
  // that uses that very generic class — the Nexus docs body does. The scope is
  // 15 bytes x 320 selectors = 4.7 KiB and cannot be backed out without
  // restoring the leak; `:where()` is already the cheapest form that keeps every
  // rule's original specificity, and the marker class is what makes it short
  // (naming both component roots cost 24 bytes more per selector). Toast's
  // stacking and swipe styles add the rest. Measured 556.2 KiB. Same contract as
  // every note above: actuals plus minimal headroom, growth from here fails.
  // 560 -> 576 on 2026-09-15: the TuffEx chart family landed (ECharts host, legend,
  // decoration, and the option presets), and its stylesheets are 12.8 KiB that did
  // not exist before. Measured 571.2 KiB. The gate never reported this because
  // `audit:types` runs first in the CI `&&` chain and was failing on the same
  // commit, so the size run never started. Same contract as every note above:
  // actuals plus minimal headroom, growth from here fails.
  // 576 -> 584 on 2026-09-15: `icon-picker` adds its panel, grid, trigger and shape
  // controls (5.1 KiB measured at dist/es/icon-picker/style.css), which took the full
  // entry to 576.3 KiB against a 576.0 limit. Same contract as every note above:
  // actuals plus minimal headroom, growth from here fails.
  // 584 -> 600 on 2026-09-22: the Beautiful UI parity round
  // (retired task 09-21-bui-parity-and-interaction) adds three
  // component stylesheets — flowchart 2.3 KiB, agent-screen 1.8, toast-panel 1.3 —
  // and grows the ones it reworked: status-badge's chip, diff-table's accept
  // layer, code-stream's diff rows, approval-card's skip, recommendation-card's
  // inline entity, card's press and selection-actions' spring keyframes.
  // Measured 595.4 KiB. Same contract as every note above: actuals plus minimal
  // headroom, growth from here fails.
  // 600 -> 608 on 2026-09-24: two tasks landed together, measured together at 606.0 KiB.
  // Retired task 09-23-composer-motion-reference adds `mode-chip` (4.0 KiB, new) and
  // reworks `chat`'s composer into a shell/card with a tray and icon buttons (~2.9 KiB
  // more), plus the text transformer's setup-state and reduced-motion rules (~0.2 KiB).
  // 09-23-nexus-base-gallery-sidebar grows `empty-state` (+2.6 KiB: the error
  // illustration redrawn, reduced motion for every illustration), `layout-skeleton`
  // (+0.8) and trims `stat-card` (-0.2). Same contract as every note above: actuals
  // plus minimal headroom, growth from here fails.
  // 608 -> 612 on 2026-09-25: `TxBottomDialog` was restyled from a centred
  // button stack into the reference bottom sheet (title/close header, full-width
  // action rows with an optional leading glyph, destructive tone, panel height
  // cap). The component's own style block goes 1.1 -> 3.6 KiB compiled, and the
  // shared `dialog/style.css` it is emitted into goes 3.8 -> 7.9 KiB. Checked for
  // the inlining this limit exists to catch: that sheet carries only
  // `.tx-bottom-dialog*` plus the sibling variant rules that already shared it.
  // Measured 610.1 KiB. Same contract as every note above: actuals plus minimal
  // headroom, growth from here fails.
  // 612 -> 618 on 2026-09-26: three components shipped sheets in one round — `prism-glow`
  // (4.9 KiB), `choice-card` (3.9) and `fusion-surface` (0.7) — and the full bundle went
  // 610.1 -> 615.9 KiB with them. Checked for the inlining this limit exists to catch: the same
  // round *removed* one, the vendored GitHub sheet that `stream-markdown` was carrying as a
  // second copy of `markdown-view`'s (39.0 KiB, the largest single line the on-demand budget
  // counted); it now borrows that sheet through a declared style dependency
  // (`borrowedStyleDeps` in packages/script/build/component-styles.ts). So the full bundle grew
  // by the new components alone while the on-demand set came down. Measured 615.9 KiB. Same
  // contract as every note above: actuals plus minimal headroom, growth from here fails.
  // 618 -> 623 on 2026-09-27: `status-hint` (TxStatusHint, retired task 09-27-corebox-action-
  // feedback-hint) ships its own stylesheet, 4.9 KiB (5054 B), and the full bundle went 616.1 ->
  // 621.0 KiB with it and nothing else (the on-demand set moved by the same 4.9 KiB, 163 -> 164
  // stylesheets, and stays under its limit). Checked for the inlining this limit exists to catch:
  // the sheet carries only `.tx-status-hint*` rules and its own `tx-status-hint-*` keyframes, none
  // of the text-transformer, text-morph or icon rules it reaches through style-deps. It slimmed
  // before asking, 5.7 -> 4.9 KiB: unscoped as TxChoiceCard is, and no `-webkit-` mask duplicate.
  // Same contract as every note above: actuals plus minimal headroom, growth from here fails.
  // 623 -> 626 on 2026-09-30: `stream-text` (TxStreamText and TxStreamCaret,
  // retired task 09-29-stream-text-foundation) ships its own stylesheet, 3.2 KiB (3231 B), all
  // of it present verbatim in components.css. The full bundle measured 624.7 KiB with it and
  // 621.5 without (the 09-28 effect ports had used 0.5 KiB of the headroom left above). Checked
  // for the inlining this limit exists to catch: the sheet carries only `.tx-stream-text*` and
  // `.tx-stream-caret*` rules and its own `tx-stream-*` keyframes, none of the inline-citation or
  // liquid rules it reaches through style-deps. Same contract as every note above: actuals plus
  // minimal headroom, growth from here fails.
  // 626 -> 629 on 2026-09-30: `stream-element` (TxStreamElement, retired task 09-29-stream-element-
  // core) ships its own stylesheet, 2.4 KiB (2484 B), all of it present verbatim in components.css.
  // The full bundle went 625.7 -> 628.1 KiB with it and nothing else; it grew by 2422 B because the
  // bundler folds the one keyframes the sheet shares with its siblings. Checked for the inlining this
  // limit exists to catch: the sheet carries only `.tx-stream-element*` rules and the
  // `tx-stream-fade-blur` keyframes its blocks enter with, none of the stream-text, code-stream or
  // stream-markdown rules it reaches through style-deps. It slimmed before asking, 2.7 -> 2.4 KiB:
  // it no longer copies the word keyframes it never plays. Same contract as every note above:
  // actuals plus minimal headroom, growth from here fails.
  // 629 -> 631 on 2026-10-02: the admin primitives (.trellis/tasks/10-02-tuffex-admin-primitives)
  // add one stylesheet and grow two. `descriptions` (TxDescriptions / TxDescriptionsItem) is new
  // at 1.3 KiB (1374 B); `data-table` grows 641 B for the skeleton loading variant (placeholder
  // rows held to one line box, and the refresh bar with its motion-gated animation), and
  // `pagination` 260 B for the page-size row. The full bundle went 628.0 -> 630.2 KiB with them and
  // nothing else: 2275 B, exactly the three sheets' growth. Checked for the inlining this limit
  // exists to catch: `descriptions/style.css` carries only `.tx-descriptions*` rules, and the two
  // grown sheets add only their own `.tx-data-table__*` / `.tx-pagination*` rules; the skeleton
  // and select styles they now reach stay in their own sheets through style-deps. It slimmed
  // before asking: the descriptions sheet is unscoped (as TxStatusHint's is) and drives both size
  // tiers from two custom properties, and the refresh cell's two declarations are inline. Same
  // contract as every note above: actuals plus minimal headroom, growth from here fails.
  // 631 -> 736 on 2026-10-05: Amicro fusion adds 14 source modules plus two SVG/pixel
  // chart families. The built full entry measured 731.8 KiB; the new root sheets total
  // 89,836 B (87.7 KiB), with chart additions and the scoped Slider lifecycle surface
  // accounting for the rest. Primitive overrides remain beneath their owning Motion
  // roots; they do not inline the input/tabs/select/Skeleton sheets. Measured actuals
  // plus minimal headroom; root/full-style import bans and per-file ceilings stay fixed.
  // 736 -> 738 on 2026-10-08: the TxCopyButton redesign (failure state, `iconOnly` with a
  // width FLIP, drawn check/cross glyphs, colour eased only across a state change) grows
  // `button/style.css` 14,708 -> 16,774 B, and TxCodeStream's copy override gains its ring
  // and failure rules, `code-stream/style.css` 6,383 -> 6,588 B. Those two sheets are the
  // only ones that moved; the full entry went 735.0 -> 737.3 KiB. It slimmed before asking:
  // the copy button is unscoped (-0.6 KiB of data-v attributes) and its two tones share one
  // rule through custom properties. Actuals plus minimal headroom, growth from here fails.
  // 738 -> 740 on 2026-10-08, the motion primitives round: `morph` (TxMorph) ships its own
  // stylesheet, 1,318 B, and three existing sheets grow by 826 B together. `transition`
  // 1,638 -> 2,272 B: the `blur` preset's rules, and TxTransitionSmoothSize's own box/measure
  // layer now that it no longer renders TxAutoSizer. `switch` 4,763 -> 4,863 B: the thumb's
  // `transition: all` became the explicit property list its spring-drawn travel needs. `charts`
  // 26,884 -> 26,976 B: TxLineSeries' draw-enter symbol fade. The full bundle went 737.3 ->
  // 739.4 KiB, exactly that growth. Checked for the inlining this limit exists to catch: the
  // morph sheet carries only the `--tx-morph-radius` registration and `.tx-morph*` rules, and
  // each grown sheet only its own component's rules. Actuals plus minimal headroom, growth
  // from here fails.
  // 740 -> 745 on 2026-10-10: FlowLight and VoiceClip add two independent sheets
  // (2,118 B and 2,549 B). CI at ff09f8a67 measured 744.0 KiB, versus 739.4 before
  // these components. Both sheets contain only their own selectors and keyframes;
  // FlowLight's surface wrappers reach its sheet through style-deps, not inlining.
  // Actuals plus minimal headroom; per-file and root/full-style import gates stay fixed.
  // 745 -> 748 on 2026-10-11: TxButton progress-bar and status state support (background
  // progress track/fill, numeric readout, drawn status glyphs, and `.is-morphing` colour
  // transitions) grows `button/style.css` after un-scoping `TxIconButton` (-0.5 KiB of
  // `data-v` attributes). Measured 746.8 KiB. Checked for inlining: `button/style.css`
  // carries only `.tx-button*`, `.tx-split-button*`, `.tx-icon-button*` and
  // `.tx-copy-button*` rules; `text-morph` stays in its own sheet through style-deps.
  // 748 -> 750 on 2026-10-14: DataTable semantic cells and column-filter panels
  // add component-owned styles; Select/form border-box corrections land alongside.
  // The final isolated 0.8.0 build measures 749.0 KiB after removing DataTable's
  // scoped-selector payload and merging duplicate declarations (751.4 before).
  // data-table/style.css contains only its BEM rules and refresh keyframes, not
  // Popover/Skeleton dependency rules. Component JS is split at the data-state
  // boundary (42.9 KiB, under the unchanged 48 KiB limit). Actuals plus minimal
  // headroom; per-file and root/full-style import gates remain unchanged.
  fullCssBytes: 750 * 1024,
  // The per-component stylesheets, added up. This is the set a consumer
  // actually installs and the on-demand plugin picks from, so it is the number
  // worth watching: it fell from 2290.6 KiB to 634.7 when dependency styles
  // stopped being copied into every package that imports them, and it climbs
  // again the moment one starts inlining another's rules.
  // 580 -> 568 on 2026-09-12: `stream-markdown` was shipping the whole vendored
  // markdown sheet twice — once through `index.ts`'s module import and again
  // through an SFC `@import` that `collectCssAssets` counted as separate CSS
  // (it deduped by chunk, not by emitted stylesheet). Both are fixed, and the
  // total fell from 613.5 KiB to 555.3 with `stream-markdown/style.css` going
  // 103.3 -> 50.1. Re-baselined against the smaller artifact so the saving
  // cannot be quietly spent, same as the `fullCssBytes` note above.
  // 568 -> 576 on 2026-09-15: the chart family's per-component stylesheets, the
  // same 12.8 KiB as the `fullCssBytes` note above. Measured 570.4 KiB across 153
  // stylesheets. Actuals plus minimal headroom, growth from here fails.
  // 576 -> 584 on 2026-09-15: `icon-picker`, as above.
  // 584 -> 592 on 2026-09-17: three components were silently shipping 0-byte
  // stylesheets. Their `index.ts` is nothing but `export * from './src'`, so
  // Rollup's default `preserveEntrySignatures: 'exports-only'` treated the entry
  // as owning no exports, dropped its chunk, and never emitted the SFC CSS.
  // Pinning `'strict'` in `component-styles.ts` restored breadcrumb (1.4 KiB),
  // pagination (2.7 KiB) and steps (6.9 KiB). Measured 587.8 KiB across 155
  // stylesheets. Actuals plus minimal headroom, growth from here fails.
  // 592 -> 596 on 2026-09-18: `sensitive-input` (TxSensitiveInput, added in 1e28b6386)
  // ships its own 6.2 KiB stylesheet. Checked for the inlining this limit exists to
  // catch: the sheet only carries `.tx-sensitive-input{,--xs,--sm,--lg}` and no other
  // component's rules. Measured 594.0 KiB across 156 stylesheets. Actuals plus minimal
  // headroom, growth from here fails.
  // 596 -> 608 on 2026-09-22: the same round as the `fullCssBytes` note above.
  // 594.0 -> 604.3 KiB across 156 -> 159 stylesheets, with nothing else in
  // tuffex or its build changed since the 09-18 note: 5.4 KiB is the three new
  // sheets and 4.9 KiB the reworked ones. Checked for the inlining this limit
  // exists to catch: each new sheet carries only its own root class
  // (`.tx-bui-flowchart`, `.tx-bui-agent-screen`, `.tx-toast-panel`). Actuals
  // plus minimal headroom, growth from here fails.
  // 608 -> 616 on 2026-09-24: the same two tasks as the `fullCssBytes` note above.
  // 604.3 -> 614.8 KiB across 159 -> 160 stylesheets. Checked for the inlining this
  // limit exists to catch: `mode-chip/style.css` carries only `.tx-mode-chip*` rules;
  // its three `.tx-text-transformer__layer` selectors are the chip's own `:deep()`
  // overrides scoped under `.tx-mode-chip__label`, not a copy of that component's sheet.
  // Actuals plus minimal headroom, growth from here fails.
  // 616 -> 620 on 2026-09-25: the `TxBottomDialog` sheet redesign in the
  // `fullCssBytes` note above, measured with it: 618.9 KiB across the same 160
  // stylesheets. Actuals plus minimal headroom, growth from here fails.
  // 620 -> 704 on 2026-10-05: the same complete fusion, measured at 702.3 KiB across
  // 184 sheets. Shared primitive CSS still travels through style-deps exactly once;
  // the new control/form selectors are local overrides, not duplicated dependencies.
  // Keep this ceiling tight; the existing root-import and 48 KiB JS gates still apply.
  // 704 -> 707 on 2026-10-07: integrating the accepted Terminal adds one
  // 2,924 B xterm/TxTerminal sheet to the 184-sheet Amicro candidate. The current
  // merged artifact measures 705.3 KiB across 185 sheets; Terminal owns this new
  // sheet and the dependency closure still imports primitive sheets once.
  // Keep the 48 KiB JS, 56 KiB per-sheet and root/full-style import gates fixed.
  // 707 -> 708.5 on 2026-10-08: the same TxCopyButton redesign as the `fullCssBytes` note
  // above, measured with it at 707.8 KiB across the same 185 sheets. The button and
  // code-stream sheets carry only their own `.tx-copy-button*` / `.tx-bui-code-stream__copy`
  // rules; the text-transformer and text-morph sheets the button now reaches stay in their
  // own files through style-deps. Actuals plus minimal headroom, growth from here fails.
  // 708.5 -> 710 on 2026-10-08: the motion primitives round of the `fullCssBytes` note, measured
  // with it at 709.9 KiB across 186 sheets: TxMorph's new 1,318 B sheet, and the transition,
  // switch and charts sheets' 826 B. The dependency closure still imports every primitive
  // sheet once.
  // 710 -> 715.5 on 2026-10-10: the same two sheets as the fullCssBytes note.
  // CI measured 714.5 KiB across 188 sheets (186 before); their dependency closure
  // still imports each primitive stylesheet once. Actuals plus minimal headroom.
  // 715.5 -> 718.5 on 2026-10-11: the same TxButton progress-bar and status rules as the
