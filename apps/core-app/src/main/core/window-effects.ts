 * through. Six of the eight window option sets request `transparent: true` with no
 * `backgroundColor`, and AppImage and deb are shipped targets — so on a session without ARGB
 * visuals those windows paint black or invisible (#806).
 *
 * The audit suggested making Linux opaque unconditionally. That is deliberately not done
 * here: most Linux desktops do run a compositor, and a blanket default would flatten the
 * launcher's translucency for all of them to protect the ones that cannot show it.
 *
 * What is actually missing is not a different default — it is a way out. Someone who cannot
 * see the launcher cannot click a setting to fix it, so the recovery has to be reachable
 * from outside the UI.

 * the same set the transparent-window ratchet counts. A window that names its own colour has
 * made a decision worth keeping: ScreenshotOverlayWindowOption asks for `#00000000` because a
 * capture overlay you cannot see through is a capture overlay you cannot use, and forcing it
