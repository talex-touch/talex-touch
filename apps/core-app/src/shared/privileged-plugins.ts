/**
 * Which plugin may hold which privileged host capability (#535).
 *
 * These capabilities — intelligence context, browser open and data, system actions, window manager
 * and presets, workspace scripts — are not authorized by the manifest permission registry. They are
 * authorized by comparing the activation's plugin name against a literal, in twelve files and
 * twenty-nine places, with no shared constant between them.
 *
 * The failure that costs is a rename, which is exactly what the 2026-02 extraction invites: every
 * gate falls through to `invalid()` or `null`, so the plugin still loads and registers and only
 * fails when a user triggers the feature. No build error, no startup warning, and the twelve files
 * have to be found by grep.
 *
 * This is a lookup table, not a policy change: the same names authorize the same capabilities as
 * before. What it buys is that a rename is one edit, and that `PRIVILEGED_PLUGIN_NAMES` gives a
 * gate somewhere to check itself against.
