 * afterwards, so on the Windows and Linux legs — the two that do not set
 * SKIP_INSTALL_APP_DEPS — a required addon went missing between the build that made it and the
 * presence check that follows. Keep a copy across the rebuild and put back what it dropped.
 *
 * Only addons that are already there are kept: a run that never built them must still fail the
 * check, with the message that says which step produces them. A copy that fails part way takes
 * the half-filled backup with it, so an unreadable addon tree leaves nothing behind either.
