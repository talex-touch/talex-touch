- Updated `fighting-design` version

### 2022-08-19
Currently, the latest version of `vitepress` is `1.0.0-alpha.8`, but the latest version has build errors. I have submitted an [issue](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress/issues/1209) to the official repository, waiting for resolution.

After testing, `1.0.0-alpha.4` is still a relatively stable version with no other issues. For packaging failures with versions `1.0.0-alpha.5` and above, you can try running PowerShell as an administrator to achieve successful packaging.

Therefore, `vitepress-template` will temporarily use the `1.0.0-alpha.4` stable version.

### 2022-08-18
- Updated `vitepress` version
- Updated theme directory alias. Before `vitepress 1.0.0-alpha.5`, the alias was `/@theme`, now updated to `@theme`. See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for details.
- Optimized configuration file location. `vite.config.ts` in the root directory does not take effect, it must be placed in the `/docs` directory to work.
- Fixed packaging error:

```shell
This rule cannot come before a "@charset" rule

  <stdin>:2:0:
    2 │ .f-main[data-v-8221e4b8] {
      ╵ ^
```

Added the following configuration in `vite.config.ts`:

```ts
css: {
  postcss: {
    plugins: [
      {
        postcssPlugin: 'internal:charset-removal',
        AtRule: {
          charset: (atRule) => {
            if (atRule.name === 'charset') {
              atRule.remove()
            }
          },
        },
      },
    ]
  }
}
