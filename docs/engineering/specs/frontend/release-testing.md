# Release Acceptance Testing

> Contract for validating an already-published Tuff release from the user-facing download path through an isolated packaged runtime.

## 1. Scope / Trigger

Run this contract whenever the user says **“发版测试”**, “release test”, “下载当前发版验证”, or asks whether a published desktop release is usable.

Default target: the version shared by root `package.json` and `apps/core-app/package.json`. A user-supplied tag overrides the default. A release test validates downloaded release bytes; workspace `dist` is never substituted.

The standard gate order is fixed:

1. Remote release identity and matrix.
2. Real host-asset download and integrity/security checks.
3. Isolated packaged runtime smoke.
4. Sanitized evidence summary and cleanup.

## 2. Signatures

```text
version := package.json.version == apps/core-app/package.json.version
tag := explicitTag ?? `v${version}`
baseUrl := https://tuff.tagzxia.com
hostPair := process.platform/process.arch
workRoot := /tmp/tuff-release-acceptance/<tag>
```

Required existing entry points:

```bash
gh release view "$TAG" --repo "talex-touch/tuff" --json tagName,isDraft,isPrerelease,publishedAt,url,assets
node "scripts/check-release-gates.mjs" \
  --tag "$TAG" --version "$VERSION" --stage gate-e \
  --base-url "https://tuff.tagzxia.com" \
  --manifest "$WORK_ROOT/downloads/tuff-release-manifest.json"
node "scripts/update-validate-release-manifest.mjs" \
  --manifest "$WORK_ROOT/downloads/tuff-release-manifest.json"
pnpm -C "apps/core-app" run visible:experience:indexing-diagnostics-probe -- \
  --appBundle "$WORK_ROOT/unpacked/tuff.app" \
  --userDataDir "$WORK_ROOT/profile" \
  --outputDir "<task-evidence-dir>" \
  --seedRecentTaskEvidence
```

macOS host checks:

```bash
shasum -a 256 "$HOST_ASSET"
/usr/bin/ditto -x -k "$HOST_ASSET" "$WORK_ROOT/unpacked"
/usr/bin/plutil -extract CFBundleShortVersionString raw "$APP/Contents/Info.plist"
/usr/bin/lipo -archs "$APP/Contents/MacOS/tuff"
/usr/bin/codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=4 "$APP"
/usr/sbin/spctl --assess --type execute --verbose=4 "$APP"
```

## 3. Contracts

### Release identity

- Root version, CoreApp version, GitHub tag, manifest `release.version/tag/channel`, Nexus release, and channel-specific latest must describe one release.
- GitHub prerelease state must match BETA/SNAPSHOT versus RELEASE.
- Record the complete GitHub inventory, but Nexus platform matrix contains only the preferred downloadable artifact per platform/architecture pair.

### Download and integrity

- Download the host artifact through the Nexus signed download URL and follow its redirect to the release asset; do not record `exp` or `sig` values.
- Download the manifest as a separate GitHub metadata asset.
- Local SHA-256 must equal both manifest SHA-256 and GitHub digest.
- Manifest validation is authoritative. Missing signature fields, duplicate platform/architecture entries, or noncanonical names remain release failures even when bytes hash correctly.

### macOS trust

- Bundle version, Mach-O architecture, and executable mode must match the target before launch.
- Ad-hoc signing (`Signature=adhoc`, no team identifier) is not release signing.
- `codesign --verify --deep --strict` must pass.
- `spctl` output containing `override=security disabled` is **blocked evidence**, not a Gatekeeper pass.
- Never remove quarantine, ad-hoc re-sign, disable Gatekeeper, or install into `/Applications` to make a release test pass.

### Isolated runtime

- Launch only the downloaded app with disposable userData and a supervised CDP port.
- Reuse the packaged indexing diagnostics probe as the minimum packaged UI contract: renderer target, Settings shell, indexed-source diagnostics, detail dialog, and typed audit fields.
- Do not log in, use provider keys, modify the real profile, or trigger updater installation.
- Windows/Linux are `static-only` on a macOS runner unless real platform evidence is supplied.

### Evidence and cleanup

- Persist only bounded, sanitized summaries. Remove signed query values, personal paths, raw userData, downloaded binaries, unpacked apps, and full logs.
- A test run may complete while the release result is `fail`; never turn a completed test execution into a successful release claim.
- Stop the supervised process and remove `/tmp/tuff-release-acceptance/<tag>` after curated evidence is written.

### Release creation

- `create-release` must fail before publishing when `RELEASE_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` is missing, malformed, or does not match the public key pinned in CoreApp/Nexus.
- Every published CoreApp package gets an RSA-SHA256 base64 `.sig`; manifest `artifacts` contains only one preferred package per `platform/arch` and names its sidecar without listing the sidecar as a downloadable artifact.
- Nexus sync consumes only validated manifest entries. Each linked asset carries the manifest SHA-256 and the matching GitHub sidecar `signatureUrl`; it must not infer or upsert `.sig` files as platform assets.
- Official macOS jobs require Developer ID credentials plus one complete Apple notarization credential set. The postprocess must preserve the electron-builder signature, use a metadata-preserving archive, and emit passed codesign/TeamIdentifier/Gatekeeper/notarization evidence before upload.
- Before GitHub Release creation, the workflow re-hashes every preferred asset, verifies every published package sidecar, merges macOS native-trust evidence, writes `release-test-summary.json` / `.md`, and appends Markdown to the Actions step summary. A failed summary blocks release creation.
- Every CI release build must create `build-attestation.json` plus `build-attestation.json.sig` inside the packaged resources before native code signing. The signed payload binds `appId`, version/channel, platform/architecture, commit, pinned-key fingerprint, and the physical `app.asar` SHA-256. Missing/mismatched `RELEASE_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` fails the build; local builds may remain explicitly unsigned.
- Packaged runtime verification is offline and fail closed for malformed, mismatched, or tampered attestations: verify the detached signature with the embedded public key, validate build identity, and hash the physical `app.asar` through Electron `original-fs`. Only a valid result sets `isOfficialBuild=true`; a package with no attestation stays unsigned without being misreported as a verification failure.
- `create-release` must run `scripts/check-release-signing-trust-roots.mjs` before collecting assets. CoreApp PEM, Nexus resource PEM, Nexus server PEM, and the Cloudflare worker fallback module must resolve to one SPKI SHA-256 fingerprint; any drift blocks publication.

## 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- **Good:** identity, manifest, signed platform matrix, local digest, native signature/Gatekeeper, and isolated packaged probe all pass; temporary state is removed.
- **Base:** host bytes, version, architecture, and runtime pass, but signatures are absent. Report release `fail` with a separate runtime `pass`—do not collapse the two.
- **Bad:** launch a workspace build instead of the downloaded artifact, install over the user's app, reuse the real profile, redact a failure, claim Windows/Linux runtime from macOS, or call a production write endpoint.

## 6. Tests Required

Each “发版测试” run must assert and record:

- GitHub tag/prerelease and full asset inventory.
- Nexus release/latest identity and preferred three-platform matrix.
- Manifest validator result and exact issue categories.
- Real Nexus host download reaches binary bytes and matches manifest/GitHub SHA-256.
- Signature endpoint results and signing-key configuration.
- Repository trust-root gate passes and the built Nexus `/api/releases/signing-key` fallback returns the same SPKI fingerprint.
- Host bundle version, architecture, executable mode, deep codesign, and Gatekeeper result.
- Packaged probe `ok`, renderer target count, Settings/diagnostics/detail visibility, audit-field gate, profile removal, and process termination.
- Packaged build-attestation result: official packages report `isOfficialBuild=true`; an attestation or `app.asar` mutation reports `verificationFailed=true`.
- Sanitization: no signed query values, credentials, personal paths, raw profiles, or downloaded packages remain in committed evidence.

## 7. Wrong vs Correct

### Wrong

```bash
# Local build and real profile prove neither the published bytes nor isolation.
pnpm build:app --target=mac --type=beta
open "apps/core-app/dist/mac-arm64/tuff.app"
# Treat an HTTP redirect or ad-hoc signature as release success.
```

### Correct

```bash
# Resolve one published tag, download through the user-facing signed endpoint,
# cross-check the exact bytes, then launch the downloaded bundle in isolation.
node scripts/check-release-gates.mjs --tag "$TAG" --version "$VERSION" \
  --stage gate-e --base-url "https://tuff.tagzxia.com" \
  --manifest "$WORK_ROOT/downloads/tuff-release-manifest.json"
shasum -a 256 "$HOST_ASSET"
pnpm -C "apps/core-app" run visible:experience:indexing-diagnostics-probe -- \
  --appBundle "$WORK_ROOT/unpacked/tuff.app" \
  --userDataDir "$WORK_ROOT/profile" \
  --outputDir "<task-evidence-dir>" --seedRecentTaskEvidence
```

## Scenario: Mandatory Apple Developer Signing and Notarization

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: every macOS beta, snapshot, and release distribution build, locally and in GitHub Actions.
- The repository owner configured Developer ID and App Store Connect API-key notarization on 2026-07-21. The former `waived` publication mode is retired; a missing credential is now a release failure.

### 2. Signatures

```text
LocalNotarizationProfile := APPLE_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE ?? "tuff-notarization"
TUFF_OFFICIAL_RELEASE_BUILD := "true" | "false"
MacSigningMode := "developer-id"

RequiredGitHubSecrets := {
  CSC_LINK,
  CSC_KEY_PASSWORD,
  APPLE_API_KEY_CONTENT,
  APPLE_API_KEY_ID,
  APPLE_API_ISSUER
}

verify-macos-release-signing.mjs \
  --mode developer-id \
  --app-bundle <path.app> \
  --output <json>
```

### 3. Contracts

- On a Darwin host, `build:beta:mac`, `build:snapshot:mac`, and `build:release:mac` default to `TUFF_OFFICIAL_RELEASE_BUILD=true`; an explicit `false` is only a local non-distribution diagnostic escape hatch. `build:unpack` remains outside this distribution contract.
- Local builds use the Developer ID identity in the login keychain. When no explicit Apple API/Apple ID/profile environment is present, the build passes `APPLE_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE=tuff-notarization` to Electron Builder.
- CI requires a password-protected PKCS#12 plus the complete App Store Connect Team API-key set. All absent, any partial group, or an Apple-ID-only configuration fails before packaging; CI never publishes `waived` native-trust evidence.
- `TUFF_OFFICIAL_RELEASE_BUILD=true` must reach both Electron Builder and macOS postprocess. Postprocess verifies the existing Developer ID signature and must never replace it with ad-hoc signing.
- Workspace modules copied into packaged `Resources/node_modules` must exclude their source `node_modules` directory. The resource dependency closure copies runtime dependencies at the package root; absolute pnpm workspace symlinks are forbidden inside the app bundle.
- Electron Builder performs Developer ID signing, hardened runtime, notarization, and stapling. The metadata-preserving ZIP is created only after Developer ID verification.
- Upload is gated by deep strict codesign, TeamIdentifier, Gatekeeper source, and stapler validation. A host with Gatekeeper globally disabled may prove Developer ID and stapling, but its `spctl override=security disabled` result remains blocked evidence rather than a Gatekeeper pass.
- Runtime/UI native trust is a read-only projection of typed `AppEvents.build.getVerificationStatus`; renderer code must not infer waiver or pass from `process.platform` alone.
- A Darwin runtime reports `pass:official-macos-release-attested` only when the packaged build attestation is official, backed by the pinned release key, and has no verification failure. This runtime projection relies on the mandatory distribution gates above; it does not replace codesign/stapler/Gatekeeper release evidence.
- Missing, unofficial, key-inconsistent, or failed build attestation reports `unverified` with an explicit reason and risk. Non-Darwin runtimes report `not-applicable`. The retired `waived:apple-developer-not-configured` sentinel must not appear in current renderer UI or diagnostic evidence.
- `SettingUpdate` shows authenticity to users through one typed projection on every desktop platform: `resolveBuildAuthenticity(BuildVerificationStatus | null)` → `official | unofficial | unknown`, where `official` requires `isOfficialBuild && hasOfficialKey && !verificationFailed`. `unofficial` (any of darwin/win32/linux, dev builds included) renders a non-dismissible `role=alert` danger banner with one stable title/description key pair and an entry to the official download page (`${NEXUS_BASE_URL}/updates`). `official` renders no trust marker at all, and `unknown` (status not yet received) renders nothing, so the banner cannot flash before verification answers. The macOS native-trust projection above (`pass | unverified | not-applicable` plus reason) is the diagnostic-evidence contract (`runtimeTarget.nativeTrust` in the exported JSON); it no longer drives UI copy. On macOS an `unofficial` build's `ready` update offers no install action at all — `MAC_UPDATE_BUILD_UNTRUSTED` would refuse it, on request and on quit — and says so in the status detail; the banner stays the only way to the download page, so the card never shows two identical calls to action.
- Published packages are immutable: correcting the renderer projection changes the next release only; an already-published app containing the stale hard-coded waiver cannot be repaired in place without invalidating its attestation and native signature.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition                                                         | Result                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Local Developer ID identity + valid `tuff-notarization` profile   | Sign, notarize, staple, then archive               |
| Local profile missing/invalid                                     | Electron Builder fails; no distributable ZIP claim |
| CI PKCS#12 or API-key group absent/partial                        | Fail in signing-mode preflight                     |
| CI resolves Apple ID instead of API key                           | Fail; Team API key is required                     |
| Workspace resource contains an absolute/out-of-bundle symlink     | Fail codesign/package gate                         |
| Electron Builder notarizes, then postprocess ad-hoc re-signs      | Fail Developer ID / stapler checks                 |
| Developer ID, timestamp, TeamIdentifier, and staple pass          | Native trust passes                                |
| `spctl` reports `override=security disabled`                      | Blocked Gatekeeper evidence; never relabel as pass |
| Official macOS attestation + pinned key + no verification failure | Renderer/evidence native trust `pass`              |
| Missing/unofficial/failed build attestation                       | Renderer/evidence `unverified`; retain risk        |
| Any desktop platform, authenticity `unofficial`                   | Update page shows the danger banner + download link |
| Authenticity `official`, or status not yet received               | No banner and no trust badge                       |
| Renderer selects trust from `darwin` alone                        | Invalid projection; fail review                    |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- **Good:** complete credentials select `developer-id`; the built and ZIP-extracted app retain Team ID, hardened runtime, secure timestamp, and a stapled ticket; no bundle symlink escapes the app.
- **Base:** local diagnostic build explicitly sets `TUFF_OFFICIAL_RELEASE_BUILD=false`; it may be ad-hoc but is not uploaded, published, or described as trusted.
- **Bad:** treat `.cer` or CSR as containing a private key, publish when Secrets are absent, copy workspace `node_modules` symlinks into Resources, or re-sign a notarized app ad-hoc during postprocess.

### 6. Tests Required

- Credential preflight: complete PKCS#12 + Team API key -> `developer-id`; absent/partial/Apple-ID-only CI configurations -> non-zero.
- Runtime resource projection: copied workspace package omits nested `node_modules`; its declared runtime dependency remains in the root resource closure; no absolute/out-of-bundle symlink survives packaging.
- Local distribution smoke: `pnpm build:app --target=mac --type=beta` logs signing/notarization, postprocess runs in `official` mode, and the command succeeds.
- Artifact verification: run deep strict codesign, inspect Authority/TeamIdentifier/Timestamp/runtime, run stapler validation and `spctl`, then repeat codesign/stapler against an extracted distribution ZIP.
- Workflow validation: actionlint passes and only complete API-key credentials can export `TUFF_OFFICIAL_RELEASE_BUILD=true`.
- Renderer projection: focused tests cover official pass, verification failure, unavailable/inconsistent attestation, and non-macOS not-applicable; packaged Settings smoke must contain no retired waiver sentinel.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```js
// A local variable enables Builder signing, but postprocess still reads an unset env flag
// and replaces the notarized signature with ad-hoc signing.
const officialMacBuild = true;
postProcessMacArtifacts(distDir, version, arch);

// Copying a pnpm workspace package also copies absolute node_modules symlinks.
fs.cpSync(sourceDir, targetDir, { recursive: true, dereference: true });
```

#### Correct

```js
process.env.TUFF_OFFICIAL_RELEASE_BUILD = "true";

fs.cpSync(sourceDir, targetDir, {
  recursive: true,
  dereference: true,
  filter(sourcePath) {
    const relativePath = path.relative(sourceDir, sourcePath);
    return (
      relativePath !== "node_modules" &&
      !relativePath.startsWith(`node_modules${path.sep}`)
    );
  },
});
```

## Scenario: Runtime OTA Provider and Integrity Boundary

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing CoreApp update discovery, Nexus/GitHub fallback, release cache, manifest parsing, update download requests, package hash/signature verification, or installer handoff.
- This contract prevents a renderer-supplied URL, an unsigned historical asset, a provider failure misclassification, or a network-supplied public key from reaching installation.

### 2. Signatures

```ts
interface UpdateDownloadRequest {
  tag: string
}

type UpdateProviderOutcome =
  | { kind: 'candidate'; source: 'nexus' | 'github'; release: GitHubRelease; usedNetwork: boolean }
  | { kind: 'none'; source: 'nexus' | 'github'; authoritative: boolean; message?: string }
  | { kind: 'policy-block'; source: 'nexus'; reason: string }
  | { kind: 'transient-failure'; source: 'nexus' | 'github'; reason: string }

validateUpdateReleaseManifest(payload, expectation):
  | { valid: true; manifest: UpdateReleaseManifest; artifact: UpdateReleaseArtifact }
  | { valid: false; reason: string }

SignatureVerifier.verifyFileSignatureWithCache(filePath, signatureUrl, signatureCachePath):
  Promise<{ valid: boolean; reason?: string }>
```

### 3. Contracts

- Renderer download requests carry only a release tag. Main reloads the persisted release and rejects missing, stale, mismatched, or unknown tags; renderer-provided URLs/checksums/signatures are never trusted.
- Official discovery is Nexus-first. A valid Nexus candidate, authoritative no-update, or policy block ends the lookup. Only timeout, network-unreachable, HTTP 429, or HTTP 5xx may query GitHub.
- Explicit HTTP status wins over message regex classification: `NETWORK_HTTP_STATUS_404` is not a network timeout and must not fall through to GitHub.
- Nexus/GitHub caches are isolated by provider identity and channel. A stale verified candidate is eligible only after both provider attempts fail.
- Both providers produce a release with explicit `source`; `UpdateSystem` resolves one normalized candidate from a schema-valid manifest and the current `platform/arch` Core artifact.
- Main streams SHA-256 and RSA-SHA256 verification. Core installation requires manifest SHA-256, detached signature URL, a locally cached signature payload, and the public key embedded in the app bundle; quit preflight never re-fetches the signature.
- `signatureKeyUrl`, runtime signing-key download, and `TUFF_UPDATE_REQUIRE_SIGNATURE` are forbidden. Missing integrity metadata is an install failure, not a compatibility mode.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition                                          | Result                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Nexus returns published candidate                  | Use Nexus; do not call GitHub                   |
| Nexus returns no release                           | Authoritative `none`; do not call GitHub        |
| Nexus returns non-published release                | `policy-block`; do not call GitHub              |
| Nexus 404/other non-transient 4xx                  | Fail; do not call GitHub                        |
| Nexus timeout/429/5xx                              | Query GitHub                                    |
| Both providers fail, verified stale cache exists   | Return stale candidate with `usedNetwork=false` |
| Manifest identity/pair/SHA/signature field invalid | Reject candidate                                |
| Renderer sends unknown/stale tag                   | Reject download request                         |
| SHA-256 mismatch or signature/key missing/invalid  | Never trigger installer/openPath                |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- **Good:** Nexus returns a signed release; main resolves its tag, streams hash/signature verification with the embedded key, and only then exposes installer handoff.
- **Base:** Nexus times out, GitHub returns the same complete manifest contract, and the normalized GitHub candidate follows the same verifier.
- **Bad:** send a full release object from renderer, treat every `NETWORK_*` error as transient, reuse one cache across providers/channels, infer a package from filename when manifest is missing, or fetch the verification key beside the signature.

### 6. Tests Required

- Provider matrix: Nexus candidate, authoritative none, policy block, timeout, 429, 5xx, non-transient 404, cache source/channel isolation, and stale cache only after both failures.
- Manifest guard: valid target pair plus identity mismatch, duplicate pair, missing target, malformed SHA-256, and missing signature sidecar name.
- Download boundary: renderer/tag request resolves a main-owned persisted release; unknown/stale tag fails.
- Integrity: every hash/signature stream chunk is consumed; no whole-package `readFile`; mismatch/missing key/missing signature cannot spawn/open an installer.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
updateSdk.download(release); // renderer controls URL and integrity metadata
if (!signatureUrl) await triggerInstallation(path);
const key = await fetch(`${origin}/api/releases/signing-key`);
```

#### Correct

```ts
updateSdk.download({ tag: release.tag_name });
const trustedRelease = await updateRepository.getRecordByTag(tag);
const candidate = await resolveUpdateCandidate(trustedRelease);
await verifySha256AndPinnedSignature(candidate);
await updateInstallCoordinator.scheduleInstallNow(verifiedTaskId);
```

## Scenario: Persistent OTA Lifecycle

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing update check/download/verification/install state, `update:get-status`, DownloadCenter update-task projection, updater restart recovery, or normal-quit installation settings.
- The contract prevents renderer booleans, DownloadCenter completion, or a legacy pending-version string from becoming application-update truth.

### 2. Signatures

```ts
type UpdateLifecyclePhase =
  | 'idle'
  | 'checking'
  | 'available'
  | 'downloading'
  | 'verifying'
  | 'ready'
  | 'install-scheduled'
  | 'handoff-started'
  | 'awaiting-health'
  | 'healthy'
  | 'recovery-required'
  | 'recovering'
  | 'recovered'
  | 'failed'

UpdateAttemptRepository.createChecking(input): Promise<UpdateLifecycleSnapshot>
UpdateAttemptRepository.transition({ attemptId, expectedRevision, expectedPhase, to, patch }):
  Promise<UpdateLifecycleSnapshot>
UpdateGetStatusResponse = UpdateOpResponse<UpdateLifecycleSnapshot>
shouldAcceptUpdateLifecycleSnapshot(current, incoming): boolean
```

### 3. Contracts

- `app_update_attempts` is the lifecycle source of truth. Release records own discovery/user decisions; DownloadCenter owns bytes and progress only.
- One partial unique SQLite index permits exactly one non-terminal attempt. Every transition is an atomic compare-and-transition on attempt id, revision, and expected phase.
- Revisions increase once per committed transition. Invalid edges, stale revisions, cross-attempt commands, and terminal resurrection fail closed.
- Download completion enters `verifying`; only streamed checksum and pinned detached-signature success enters `ready`. Completion alone never launches an installer.
- `update:get-status` and update action responses expose the authoritative snapshot. Renderer accepts a same-attempt snapshot only when its revision is not older, and orders different attempts by `createdAt`.
- `installOnNormalQuit` replaces the legacy immediate-handoff setting and defaults true. New-key values win; legacy true/false values migrate once; unlinked pending-version strings are removed, not promoted to `ready`.
- Automatic download starts from every check path that leaves an attempt in `available`: a network result and a cached or persisted result alike. `synchronizeCachedCheckResult` calls the same `maybeAutoDownloadLifecycle` as the network path, with the same gates (packaged app, `autoDownload === true`, tag not already in flight). It does so only when the returned phase is `available`: a cached result must never reach a `ready` or `downloading` attempt. Before this, a restart inside the check-frequency window left auto-download users on "update available".

| Condition                                                   | Result                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Second active attempt                                       | SQLite unique constraint / lifecycle conflict           |
| Expected revision or phase changed                          | `UPDATE_LIFECYCLE_CONFLICT`; persisted row unchanged    |
| Download cancelled                                          | `downloading -> available`; task reference cleared      |
| Download failed                                             | `failed` with stable retryable error                    |
| Checksum/signature fails                                    | `failed`; installer handoff forbidden                   |
| Process restarts during DownloadCenter task                 | Restore attempt by task id and resume status monitoring |
| Process restarts during verification                        | Re-run verification before `ready`                      |
| Incoming renderer snapshot is stale                         | Retain the newer snapshot                               |
| Legacy pending version lacks trusted task/integrity linkage | Remove it and require a new download                    |
| Cached/persisted result marks `available`, auto-download on | Auto-download starts, same gates as a network result    |
| Cached result while an attempt is `ready`/`downloading`     | No download call; the active attempt is untouched       |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- **Good:** a persisted attempt survives process restart, DownloadCenter reports completion, verification commits `ready`, and all consumers observe the same revisioned snapshot.
- **Base:** a download is cancelled, the attempt returns to `available`, and a later explicit download can retry without another active row.
- **Bad:** infer ready from a completed task, keep lifecycle in renderer refs, update phase without CAS, resurrect a terminal attempt, or treat a pending version string as verified state.

### 6. Tests Required

- Reducer: full healthy path, every legal edge, cancellation, stable failure, invalid edge, stale revision, cross-attempt command, terminal duplicate.
- Repository: production migration, restart restore, revision CAS, stale write preservation, one-active uniqueness, terminal-to-new-attempt behavior.
- Service/settings: snapshot responses, download completion never auto-hands-off, new/legacy/missing setting precedence, and legacy-key removal.
- Renderer/shared: stale revision, terminal resurrection, and cross-attempt `createdAt` ordering.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
if (downloadTask.status === "completed") downloadReady.value = true;
settings.pendingInstallVersion = version;
await installUpdate(taskId); // completion path launches installer
```

#### Correct

```ts
const verifying = await attempts.transition({
  expectedPhase: "downloading",
  to: "verifying",
});
await updateSystem.verifyDownloadedUpdate(verifying.taskId!);
const ready = await attempts.transition({
  expectedPhase: "verifying",
  to: "ready",
});
if (shouldAcceptUpdateLifecycleSnapshot(current, ready)) current = ready;
```

## Scenario: Unified OTA Install Handoff and Recovery

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing install-now, normal-quit installation, Electron quit handling, platform installer commands, startup health, or previous-version recovery.
- This contract prevents system shutdown from installing, modules from closing before OTA preflight, helper replay, and a launched installer from being reported as a healthy update.

### 2. Signatures

```ts
type QuitIntentKind =
  | 'user-normal'
  | 'update-now'
  | 'system-shutdown'
  | 'startup-failure'
  | 'duplicate-instance'
  | 'other'

UpdateInstallCoordinator.scheduleInstallNow(taskId): Promise<UpdateLifecycleSnapshot>
UpdateInstallCoordinator.handleBeforeQuit(intent): Promise<void>
UpdateInstallCoordinator.handleWillQuit(intent): void
UpdateInstallCoordinator.confirmStartupHealth(): Promise<void>

UpdateHandoffPlanV1 := {
  schemaVersion: 1
  attemptId: string
  token: string
  parentPid: number
  currentVersion: string
  targetVersion: string
  taskId: string
  packagePath: string
  ackPath: string
  markerPath: string
  handoff: UpdateHandoffCommand
  recovery: UpdateHandoffCommand | null
}

HelperChildEnv := process.env - { ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE }
```

### 3. Contracts

- `UpdateInstallCoordinator` is the only application-update installer owner. Transport actions schedule a verified task and request typed quit; they never spawn/open an installer directly.
- `user-normal` may hand off only when `installOnNormalQuit=true`; `update-now` may hand off only an `install-now` lifecycle. System shutdown, startup failure, duplicate instance, and other exits never prepare or launch OTA.
- `ModuleManager` awaits `BEFORE_MODULES_UNLOAD` before stop/destroy. OTA hash, cached detached-signature verification, plan persistence, previous selection, and `handoff-started` CAS complete there while SQLite is writable.
- Actual `will-quit` performs only detached helper spawn/unref. The helper waits for the parent PID to exit, rejects escaped/stale/mismatched/replayed plans, and performs at most one recovery.
- The installed source version owns and launches the helper for both handoff and recovery. A helper fix shipped only inside target N+1 cannot change the N -> N+1 transition; packaged acceptance for a helper change requires an official source N containing the fix and a distinct official target N+1.
- Every waited or detached helper child inherits the source environment except `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`, which must be deleted before spawn. Preserve unrelated variables, including isolated profile paths; otherwise Electron may execute the target app in Node mode and exit without startup health.
- macOS uses DownloadCenter plus apply/restore scripts and a retained `.app` backup. Windows resolves interactive NSIS/MSI commands. Linux accepts only executable AppImage or `xdg-open` deb handoff. Unsupported formats fail closed.
- macOS mount cleanup always attempts best-effort `hdiutil detach "$MOUNT_DIR"`; it must not preflight with textual `mount` output because the same path may be rendered as `/tmp/...` or `/private/tmp/...`.
- A detached signature is fetched and cached during verification; install preflight re-verifies package bytes against the local cache and pinned key without network access.
- Target startup moves `handoff-started -> awaiting-health`; only target-version match plus completed renderer/main/module readiness and writable repository moves to `healthy` and writes the token-bound ack.
- Healthy startup atomically promotes exactly one verified package as future previous. A recovery marker plus old-version startup moves `recovery-required -> recovering -> recovered`; helper/runtime JSON never overrides another SQLite attempt or token.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition                                                                          | Result                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quit intent is not `user-normal`/`update-now`                                      | Leave `ready` unchanged; no plan/helper                       |
| Normal quit setting is false                                                       | Leave `ready` unchanged                                       |
| Task, checksum, cached signature, schema, path, token, or platform command invalid | `failed`; no helper                                           |
| Duplicate BEFORE/WILL/helper execution                                             | Idempotent; one plan and one helper/recovery                  |
| Target version starts and readiness completes                                      | `awaiting-health -> healthy`; promote previous; ack           |
| Current/previous version remains intact                                            | `recovery-required -> recovering -> recovered`; recovered ack |
| Unrelated version or recovery unavailable                                          | Stay `recovery-required`; never mark healthy                  |
| Health timeout with previous asset                                                 | Write marker and launch previous once                         |
| Health timeout without previous asset                                              | Write `recovery-required`; no fake rollback success           |
| Child spawn would inherit `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`                                   | Remove it before handoff/recovery spawn; preserve other env   |
| `mount` renders the stage path through `/private/tmp`                               | Still attempt detach by `MOUNT_DIR`; cleanup remains bounded  |
| Helper fix exists only in target N+1                                               | N -> N+1 is not proof; wait for fixed official N -> N+1 pair  |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- **Good:** verified task schedules typed update quit, pre-unload persists the plan, will-quit launches one helper, target startup becomes healthy, and one previous package remains.
- **Base:** first Windows/Linux install has no previous package; timeout records recovery-required without repeating an installer. A failed macOS attempt with no compatible previous asset preserves its marker, backup, and authoritative SQLite phase for diagnosis.
- **Bad:** call `shell.openPath`/`autoUpdater.quitAndInstall` from the action, infer success from UAC/process spawn, fetch signatures during quit, unload SQLite before coordinator preflight, inherit `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` into the target, or skip detach because `/tmp` and `/private/tmp` strings differ.

### 6. Tests Required

- Quit intent priority/default plus duplicate/startup/system/user-normal gates.
- Coordinator schedule, BEFORE/WILL idempotence, task mismatch, target/wrong-version health, recovered/recovery-required reconciliation.
- ModuleManager assertion that async `BEFORE_MODULES_UNLOAD` completes before module stop/destroy.
- Plan/store path escape, schema/token mismatch, replay, one-previous atomic rotation, and stale-marker isolation.
- macOS/NSIS/MSI/AppImage/deb command selection and unsupported-format rejection.
- Helper parent wait, matching healthy/recovered ack, timeout recovery once, and no-previous marker using only temp fixtures.
- Waited and detached child tests set `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`, assert the child observes it as absent, and assert an unrelated isolated-profile sentinel survives. Mutation must prove removing the env scrub makes the test fail.
- macOS script contracts assert detach is attempted without a `mount | grep` gate and exercise a `/tmp` stage path whose system projection may be `/private/tmp`.
- Packaged helper changes are accepted only with two post-fix official versions: the source package proves it owns the fixed helper, and the target package proves startup reaches token-bound `healthy`.
- Detached-signature cache proves first download plus second offline verification and tamper failures.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
await shell.openPath(packagePath);
app.quit();
return { success: true }; // process launch is not install/health success
```

#### Correct

```ts
await updateInstallCoordinator.scheduleInstallNow(taskId);
// BEFORE_MODULES_UNLOAD: verify local bytes/cache, persist plan, CAS handoff-started
// will-quit: spawn detached helper once; helper strips ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE
// target startup readiness: CAS healthy, then write token-bound ack
```

```bash
# Always attempt the concrete detach; hdiutil owns path normalization.
/usr/bin/hdiutil detach "$MOUNT_DIR" -quiet >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
```

## Scenario: Ready Notification and Strict Silent macOS Update

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing automatic update prompts, DownloadCenter completion handling, lifecycle broadcasts, native update notifications, install-now clicks, or macOS apply/restore scripts.
- This contract prevents a byte-complete package from being presented as installable, prevents notification clicks from becoming dead ends, and prevents a macOS update from surprising the user with a password prompt after the app has already quit.

### 2. Signatures

```ts
UpdateEvents.lifecycleChanged: UpdateLifecycleSnapshot -> void
UpdateSdk.onLifecycleChanged(handler): () => void

interface UpdateAttemptRepositoryOptions {
  onCommitted?: (snapshot: UpdateLifecycleSnapshot) => void
  onObserverError?: (error: unknown) => void
}

NotificationService.showUpdateReadyNotification({
  version,
  platform,
  onClick,
}): boolean

assertPlatformInstallPreflight(input): void

type UpdateInstallPreflightErrorCode =
  | 'MAC_UPDATE_DESTINATION_NOT_WRITABLE'
  | 'MAC_UPDATE_BUILD_UNTRUSTED'
```

### 3. Contracts

- `DownloadCenter.completed` advances the attempt to `verifying`; it never emits an update-ready notification and never starts installation.
- A committed `verifying -> ready` transition is the sole ready notification boundary. Repository observers run only after the SQLite transaction commits; observer failure cannot rewrite or reject the committed lifecycle.
- Main broadcasts every committed snapshot through the typed lifecycle event. Renderer applies the existing revision guard and never rebuilds phase from download events.
- With `autoDownload=true`, `available` starts or restores background preparation without a blocking release dialog. Manual-download mode may still show an explicit Download Update action.
- A ready native notification owns a main-process callback. One click schedules the matching verified task through `UpdateInstallCoordinator`; it does not open Settings and does not require a second in-app confirmation.
- macOS install-now requires an official verified build, pinned official key, no attestation failure, and direct read/execute access to the current app plus write/execute access to its parent directory.
- macOS preflight failure leaves the attempt at `ready`, sets no update quit intent, and does not call `app.quit()`.
- macOS apply and restore scripts must not call AppleScript, `sudo`, or any administrator-prompt fallback. A direct replacement failure restores the backup and reopens the old app; an unrecoverable restore preserves the marker/backup for diagnosis.
- Windows NSIS/MSI and Linux AppImage/deb reuse the same ready-click lifecycle, but installer/UAC/package-manager interaction remains explicit and is not reported as healthy until startup health passes.
- `ShellUpdateNotice` lives outside the sidebar route transition and reads the shared `useUpdateRuntime.lifecycleSnapshot`; its mount-time `getUpdateStatus()` hydrates restored ready state without adding another lifecycle subscription. Only `ready + attemptId + taskId + targetVersion` displays the notice.
- Deferring a notice records only its attemptId in component-local presentation state. The quiet entry survives route changes and rail mode; reopening/defer moves keyboard focus to the remaining action after `nextTick()`. Installation reuses `installDownloadedUpdate(taskId)` with a pending-click guard; macOS unavailable/untrusted public build status routes to `/setting/update` rather than exposing a restart action.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Download task reports completed but integrity verification is pending           | `verifying`; no ready notification                                                   |
| Ready transition commits                                                        | typed lifecycle push; at most one ready notification per attempt/process             |
| Duplicate notification click or concurrent Settings click                       | one `ready -> install-scheduled`; stale caller receives lifecycle conflict           |
| Restored process starts with an active ready attempt                            | publish ready again and offer one notification in the new process; do not redownload |
| macOS build is unofficial, unattested, key-inconsistent, or verification failed | `MAC_UPDATE_BUILD_UNTRUSTED`; remain ready; do not quit                              |
| macOS app or parent directory is not directly writable                          | `MAC_UPDATE_DESTINATION_NOT_WRITABLE`; remain ready; no password prompt              |
| macOS direct replacement fails after quit                                       | restore backup and reopen old app; helper records failure/recovery state             |
| Windows/Linux handoff process starts                                            | `handoff-started`; not healthy until matching target startup ack                     |
| Main window starts after ready was already published                            | status SDK hydration supplies the notice; no second download or lifecycle state store |
| User defers the same attempt, changes route, or receives its snapshot again     | preserve quiet entry; do not reopen the notice                                      |
| A new ready attempt arrives, or the user opens the quiet rail entry             | show the notice; rail entry also expands the sidebar                                |
| Install request is pending or rejected                                         | ignore repeated clicks; on rejection retain ready and existing error feedback       |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: background download verifies to ready, one native notification appears, one click schedules typed quit, a trusted writable macOS app is replaced without UI or password prompts, and the new process reaches health.
- Base: a trusted update is ready but the current macOS app is not writable; the app stays running and ready, shows a stable remediation reason, and preserves the verified package.
- Bad: show “Update Ready” on raw download completion, route the notification click only to an unconsumed renderer event, call `app.quit()` before writability/trust preflight, or fall back to `osascript ... with administrator privileges`.

### 6. Tests Required

- Transport/SDK round-trip for `lifecycleChanged`; renderer rejects stale revisions.
- Repository observer receives created/transitioned snapshots after commit and receives nothing for a failed CAS.
- Update service suppresses the blocking available dialog in auto-download mode, notifies only on ready, dedupes by attempt id, and re-notifies a restored ready attempt in a new process.
- Notification click callback is single-fire and schedules only the matching task.
- macOS preflight covers trusted+writable, untrusted, unresolved bundle, and non-writable destination; failure asserts lifecycle remains ready and `requestQuit` is untouched.
- Shell checks and temp-bundle smoke assert apply/restore contain no elevation path, preserve backup, replace directly, restore directly, relaunch, and write timestamped phase evidence.
- Packaged macOS acceptance uses an official attested N+1 artifact and records ready, click, quit, helper, replacement, new-process, and health timestamps. Workspace or unsigned `--dir` builds cannot prove the silent-install trust gate.
- In-app notice smoke covers pre-ready silence, restored ready hydration, defer/reopen focus, route persistence, rail entry, a new attempt, narrow/localized layout, and single-request installation rejection. Seeded isolated lifecycle rows and renderer trust projection can prove UI and fail-closed behavior only; they do not prove download integrity or an official N+1 replacement.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
if (task.status === "completed") {
  showUpdateReadyNotification(task.id);
}
notification.on("click", () => broadcast("install-update"));

```

#### Correct

  expectedPhase: "verifying",
  to: "ready",
});
publishLifecycleSnapshot(ready);

assertPlatformInstallPreflight({
  platform,
  executablePath,
  buildVerificationStatus,
});
await updateInstallCoordinator.scheduleInstallNow(ready.taskId!);

```bash
if ! install_direct; then
  restore_backup
  open "$DEST_APP" || true
  exit 1
fi
```

## Scenario: Manifest v2 N-1 Rollback Compatibility

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing OTA manifest generation/validation, Nexus release metadata, lifecycle persistence, normal-quit installation, automatic recovery, or downgrade acceptance evidence.
- The manifest owns the rollback target. Nexus, CoreApp, renderer, and evidence consumers must not derive a second target.

### 2. Signatures

```ts
type UpdateReleaseManifestV2 = {
  schemaVersion: 2
  release: {
    version: string
    channel: 'RELEASE' | 'BETA'
    tag: string
    rollbackFromVersion: string
    rollbackCompatible: boolean
  }
  artifacts: UpdateReleaseArtifact[]
}

type UpdateLifecycleSnapshotRollback = {
  rollbackFromVersion: string | null
  rollbackCompatible: boolean
  installOnNormalQuit: boolean
  previousVersion: string | null
  recoveryAvailable: boolean
}

app_update_attempts.rollback_from_version: TEXT NULL
app_update_attempts.rollback_compatible: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
```

```bash
node scripts/resolve-update-rollback-version.mjs --tag <vN> --remote <git-remote>
node scripts/update-validate-release-manifest.mjs \
  --manifest <json> --expected-rollback-from-version <N-1>
node scripts/validate-update-downgrade-evidence.mjs --evidence <json>
```

### 3. Contracts

- `schemaVersion` is exactly `2`. `rollbackFromVersion` is required, omits `v`, normalizes `ALPHA`/`BETA`/`SNAPSHOT` to channel `BETA`, normalizes `MASTER`/no suffix to `RELEASE`, and is strictly older than `release.version`.
- The release resolver semver-sorts remote tags and selects the highest strictly older normalized same-channel version. Missing N-1 fails the release; input tag order is never authoritative.
- `rollbackCompatible` defaults to `false`. Setting it to `true` requires canonical downgrade evidence bound to current=N-1, target=N, all required platform pairs, a real host packaged-isolated runtime result, and a detached SHA-256 signature verified by the pinned release public key.
- Release workflow shell steps must extract `rollbackCompatible` with value-preserving `jq -r`, not truthiness-validating `jq -e`: `false` is the valid default and must not terminate a `set -e` sync job.
- CoreApp may download/install a non-exact upgrade manually, but runtime compatibility is true only when the installed current version exactly equals manifest `rollbackFromVersion`. Prerelease suffixes are significant.
- SQLite persists compatibility on the attempt. `user-normal` handoff and automatic recovery require both attempt compatibility and the user setting. Explicit `install-now` remains allowed when compatibility is false.
- Windows/Linux recovery additionally requires a cached previous package whose exact version equals `rollbackFromVersion`. macOS restore requires the current bundle version to equal that target.
- Renderer state is a revision-guarded read-only lifecycle projection. Download completion is only a refresh trigger; it is never lifecycle truth.
- On a macOS host, win32/x64 and linux/x64 evidence remains `static-only`. Current official macOS release evidence requires native-trust `pass`; runtime attestation gaps remain `unverified`, while `waived:apple-developer-not-configured` is historical evidence only.

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- **Good:** remote N-1 resolver selects the exact predecessor; canonical signed evidence binds N-1/N; all consumers preserve the metadata; exact-current normal quit and recovery are enabled.
- **Base:** manifest v2 is valid but compatibility is false or installed current is not exact N-1. Download and explicit install-now remain available; normal-quit and automatic recovery stay disabled.
- **Bad:** infer rollback from Nexus latest/current local state, accept manifest v1, compare only major/minor/patch while dropping prerelease suffixes, label static metadata as runtime, or treat a GitHub fallback as a successful Nexus gate.

### 6. Tests Required

- Shared/runtime/CLI validators: valid lower same-channel plus missing, malformed, equal, future, `v`-prefixed, cross-channel, and wrong expected N-1.
- Resolver: unsorted tags, current tag absent, preview aliases, prerelease sequence, and no predecessor.
- Asset preparation: compatibility false without evidence; compatibility true with missing/wrong/noncanonical evidence or signature; canonical exact signed evidence success.
- Attempt repository: migrations `0028 -> 0030`, false/null defaults, CAS update, and reload round-trip.
- Coordinator/platform adapters: incompatible normal quit blocked, explicit install-now allowed, exact previous package required, and prerelease suffix mismatch rejected.
- Renderer/evidence: revision/terminal guard, all lifecycle action gates, rollback/recovery/error fields, and explicit macOS waiver risk.
- Remote/summary gates: exact three-pair matrix, digest/metadata drift, Nexus transient blocked fallback, fake runtime, temporary profile, and native-trust false-pass rejection.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
const rollbackFromVersion = nexusLatest.version;
const recoveryAvailable = Boolean(previousAsset);
if (downloadFinished) lifecycle.phase = "ready";
```

#### Correct

```ts
const rollbackFromVersion = manifest.release.rollbackFromVersion;
const rollbackCompatible =
  manifest.release.rollbackCompatible &&
  installedVersion === rollbackFromVersion;
const recoveryAvailable =
  rollbackCompatible && previousAsset?.version === rollbackFromVersion;
// Renderer accepts only a revision-valid UpdateLifecycleSnapshot from main.
```

## Scenario: Update Settings Page — Status, Progress and Local History

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing any of these:
  - `SettingUpdate.vue`, `SettingUpdateStatus.vue` or `SettingUpdateHistory.vue`
  - `update-status-display.ts` or `useUpdateDownloadProgress.ts`
  - `useUpdateRuntime().checkApplicationUpgrade` / `getUpdateHistory`
  - the `update:service:get-history` handler, or `UpdateAttemptRepository.listTerminalAttempts`
- What it prevents (all four shipped once):
  - a download button that silently does nothing;
  - a download with no visible progress;
  - a version label that reads `vdev` / `vrelease`;
  - a local history that turns back into the remote release-notes browser removed on 2026-07-31.

### 2. Signatures

```ts
// packages/utils
type UpdateHistoryOutcome = 'updated' | 'rolled-back' | 'failed'
interface UpdateHistoryEntry {
  attemptId: string
  fromVersion: string // app version, no `v` (2.4.14-beta.46)
  toVersion: string // release tag as stored, keeps its `v` (v2.4.14-beta.47)
  channel: AppPreviewChannel
  outcome: UpdateHistoryOutcome
  finishedAt: number // attempt.updatedAt of the terminal transition
  error: UpdateLifecycleError | null
}
UpdateEvents.getHistory // 'update:service:get-history'
  // request  UpdateGetHistoryRequest  { limit?: number }
  // response UpdateGetHistoryResponse UpdateOpResponse<UpdateHistoryEntry[]>, newest first
UpdateSdk.getHistory(payload?: { limit?: number })

// main
UpdateAttemptRepository.listTerminalAttempts(max = 200): Promise<UpdateLifecycleSnapshot[]>
buildUpdateHistory(snapshots, limit?): UpdateHistoryEntry[]

// renderer
checkApplicationUpgrade(force = false, options?: { presentDialog?: boolean }) // presentDialog defaults true
getUpdateHistory(limit?): Promise<UpdateHistoryEntry[]> // [] on any failure
resolveUpdateStatusView(input): { kind: 'skeleton' } | UpdateStatusRowView
formatUpdateVersionLabel(value): string // trim, strip v/V, prefix v; '' for empty
AUTO_DOWNLOAD_GRACE_MS = 15_000
DOWNLOAD_START_TIMEOUT = 30_000 // renderer timeout for update:download only
```

### 3. Contracts

- **Two sources of truth.** The status row is a pure projection of the revisioned lifecycle snapshot (the Persistent OTA Lifecycle scenario) plus DownloadCenter bytes.
  - Progress comes from `task-progress` / `task-updated` pushes: take the task whose id equals `snapshot.taskId`, or any `APP_UPDATE` task before the snapshot names one.
  - On mount it is backfilled once with `getTaskStatus({ taskId })`. A late backfill never overwrites a newer push.
  - The lifecycle snapshot carries no progress fields; do not add them.
- **Running version.** It is `useEnv().packageJson.version`, the value the sidebar shows.
  - `startupInfo.version` is the `TalexTouch.AppVersion` enum, `'dev' | 'release'` (`core/touch-app.ts`). It is never a version and never a beta signal.
  - `snapshot.currentVersion` is where the latest attempt started, so it goes stale after an update. It is only a fallback.
- **Version labels.** Every version shown on the page goes through `formatUpdateVersionLabel`: tags and app versions differ only by the `v`. Never compare a raw tag with an app version.
- **Page-initiated checks never open the modal.** The update page's check/retry and channel switch call `checkApplicationUpgrade(true, { presentDialog: false })`.
  - The "发现新版本" dialog awaits the user. While it is open the page cannot refresh its cached release, so its own download button stays disabled.
  - The non-forced callers (`useLayoutController`, `useAppLifecycle`) keep the default.
- **Channel switching is not version ordering.** Saving a channel triggers the page's forced check against that channel. Main compares complete versions with the shared comparator for both fresh and cached candidates: `2.4.14` upgrades `2.4.14-beta.58`, but an older base version, the same version, or a same-base prerelease below an installed stable build must never become an upgrade just because the selected channel changed. An accepted candidate starts the existing automatic-download lifecycle when `autoDownload` is on; off leaves it `available`. Channel priority must not override semantic version ordering. This does not bypass manifest/signature checks or the `rollbackCompatible` normal-quit install gate, and fixing source code does not hot-patch an already-installed signed app.
- **Download start.** `update:download` uses `DOWNLOAD_START_TIMEOUT`. Main resolves the manifest (up to 8s) before the attempt reaches `downloading`, so the 4s channel default reported a failure for a download that then started. The button stays loading until the lifecycle leaves `available`.
- **Auto-download grace.** With `autoDownload` on, an `available` attempt shows "正在准备下载" with no action for `AUTO_DOWNLOAD_GRACE_MS`, counted from when the page saw it, and only then offers 下载更新. This keeps the page from starting a manual download that races the automatic one.
- **Visibility.**
  - The first card holds only the authenticity banner, the status row and the channel row.
  - The channel row shows for a beta build, a selected Beta channel, or developer mode. Once shown it stays for the visit.
  - Developer mode (`appSetting.dev.developerMode`) gates the 高级 card: frequency, the 自动更新 switch, notifications, GitHub packages, diagnostics, and Renderer Override (still env-gated as well).
  - No row carries a description, except the banner sentence and Renderer Override.
  - The status row never shows an idle label or a trust badge.
- **自动更新 switch.** Its value is `autoDownload`. On writes `{ autoDownload: true, installOnNormalQuit: true }`, off writes both false, and a failed save reverts both.
- **History is local.**
  - Source: `app_update_attempts` rows in `healthy | recovered | failed` with a target version.
  - Deduplicated by raw tag, newest wins. The limit is clamped to 1–50 and defaults to 20.
  - The card shows 5 rows and expands to 20. It refreshes when an attempt reaches a terminal phase and renders nothing when empty.
  - It fetches no release notes.
- **Loading.** The status card is a `SettingSkeleton` behind `useDeferredLoading` until both the first snapshot and the package version exist. The history and 高级 cards render only after the status slot is filled, so nothing reflows when the slower status call answers. The settings pages are KeepAlive-cached: returning to the page does not remount it.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition                                                        | Result                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `get-history` without an attempt repository                      | `{ success: true, data: [] }`                                               |
| `get-history` repository throws                                  | `{ success: false, error }` + warn; renderer returns `[]`; card hidden      |
| `limit` missing / NaN / fractional / >50 / <1                    | 20 / 20 / floor / 50 / 1                                                    |
| Same tag failed twice, then succeeded                            | One row, `updated`                                                          |
| Attempt failed during `checking` (no target version)             | Not in history                                                              |
| `update:download` answers after 8s                               | No failure toast; button loading until `downloading`                        |
| Page check finds an update                                       | No dialog; row shows 正在准备下载 / 发现新版本; download enabled at once    |
| Page mounts while a download runs                                | First paint already shows percent, size and speed                           |
| `downloading` but the task is gone from memory (restart)         | Indeterminate bar (known DownloadCenter restart gap, not a UI fault)        |
| macOS `unofficial` + `ready`                                     | No action; `readyBlocked` detail; the banner is the only download entry     |
| `startupInfo.version` used as the app version                    | Invalid: renders `vdev` / `vrelease` and hides the beta channel row         |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- **Good:** the user opens the page mid-download and sees the real percentage on first paint; it reaches `ready`, and the row offers the platform install action with "退出 Tuff 时会自动安装" when normal-quit install is armed.
- **Base:** a release build with developer mode off shows one row, 已是最新版本 with the real `v` version and 检查更新, plus history once an update has finished here.
- **Bad:**
  - pop the update dialog from the page;
  - read progress from the lifecycle snapshot;
  - label versions from `startupInfo`;
  - fetch release notes into history;
  - render the history card above an empty status slot.

### 6. Tests Required

- `update-history.test.ts`: outcome mapping, dedupe (repeated failures collapse; fail-then-success shows success), limit clamping incl. NaN/Infinity, ordering independent of input order, empty input.
- `update-attempt-repository.test.ts`: `listTerminalAttempts` excludes `idle`, non-terminal and target-less rows (real SQLite + migrations).
- `UpdateService.test.ts`:
  - the cached/persisted hit starts auto-download, including the restart-in-frequency-window path;
  - switching `2.4.14-beta.58` to Release finds `v2.4.14` and enters `downloading` automatically, while disabling automatic download leaves the same candidate `available`;
  - switching channels never downgrades an installed newer base version or stable build to an older/same-base preview; a genuinely newer preview remains eligible when Beta is selected;
  - `autoDownload` false does not start it;
  - an active or `ready` attempt does not start it;
  - the `get-history` handler success and failure;
  - removing the added call must fail the "starts" cases.
- `useUpdateRuntime.test.ts`: download still pending at 29.999s, fails at 30s; `presentDialog: false` never calls the dialog while the default still does; `getUpdateHistory` returns `[]` on reject and on `success: false`.
- `update-status-display.test.ts`: every lifecycle phase row, both sides of the grace window, macOS-unofficial `ready`, `formatUpdateVersionLabel` for `v` / `V` / bare / empty, and every emitted i18n key present in both locales.
- `useUpdateDownloadProgress.test.ts`: task-id matching, other modules ignored, mount backfill, stale backfill never overwrites a push, cleared on leaving `downloading`, disposed with its scope.
- `SettingUpdate.channel.test.ts`:
  - mock `startupInfo.version` with its real shape (`'release'` / `'dev'`) and the version through `env-hooks`;
  - a beta package with Release selected and developer mode off still shows the channel row;
  - the check and channel switch pass `{ presentDialog: false }`;
  - skeleton before the first snapshot, and no card above an empty status slot;
  - the history toggle sits inside a row.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
const version = startupInfo.value?.version // 'dev' | 'release'
const isBetaBuild = splitUpdateTag(version).channelLabel === 'beta' // always false
await checkApplicationUpgrade(true) // awaits a modal; the page cannot refresh until it closes
await refreshCachedRelease(channel)
```

#### Correct

```ts
const { packageJson } = useEnv()
const appVersion = computed(() => packageJson.value?.version ?? null)
const isBetaBuild = computed(
  () =>
    resolveUpdateChannelLabel(splitUpdateTag(appVersion.value ?? '').channelLabel) ===
    AppPreviewChannel.BETA
)
await checkApplicationUpgrade(true, { presentDialog: false }) // the status row shows the result
await refreshStatus()
await refreshCachedRelease(channel)
```
