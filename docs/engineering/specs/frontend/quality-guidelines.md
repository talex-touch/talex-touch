# Quality Guidelines

> Frontend quality standards, forbidden patterns, and verification expectations.

---

## Overview

Quality in this repo means matching the owning surface, preserving trust boundaries, and proving the exact behavior changed. A focused test can close a narrow code contract, but it cannot replace packaged Electron evidence, real-profile migration evidence, or production/preview Nexus evidence when a roadmap item explicitly requires those artifacts.

---

## Forbidden Patterns

- Raw `ipcMain`, `ipcRenderer`, raw channels, or ad-hoc preload exposure in CoreApp.
- New browser-native clipboard fallback in plugins, such as `navigator.clipboard`, when plugin clipboard SDK permission gates should be used.
- Plugin shell/network/fs/clipboard/window/AI mutations after permission SDK failure, missing SDK, or user denial.
- Plaintext provider secrets, API keys, tokens, prompts, responses, recovery codes, or sensitive paths in ordinary JSON, localStorage, logs, analytics, or sync payloads.
- New `div/span @click` for normal controls when native `button`, `input`, `select`, tabs, menus, or TuffEx primitives can express the control.
- Nexus SSR output that depends on `window`, `document`, localStorage, random values, current time, or unhydrated user state.
- Mock, dry-run, local-only, or isolated evidence marked as production completion.
- Mixing unrelated CoreApp, Nexus, plugin, package, and docs changes in one slice.

---

## Required Patterns

- Use TuffEx for new primitives and semantic interactive controls.
- Use typed transport/domain SDKs instead of raw channels.
- Fail closed with an explicit reason when a permission, SDK, host capability, provider, or platform dependency is unavailable.
- Keep user-facing text in the owning message catalog or localized manifest path.
- Preserve existing class/event contracts during semantic UI migrations.
- Normalize untrusted or cross-layer payloads at the boundary.
- Keep generated chunks, local profiles, raw logs, and exploratory evidence out of source changes unless an evidence README explicitly lists them as curated artifacts.
- Completing onboarding must mark the beginner state durably before closing the guide. The ordinary action may hide the primary window; shortcut completion must first offer a localized choice. “Keep exploring” leaves the primary window visible and does not summon CoreBox. “Hide and open CoreBox” hides through the host app SDK before summoning CoreBox.
- CoreBox's `WindowManager.setPinned(pinned)` must no-op when the pin state is unchanged; broad `APP_SETTING` notifications include onboarding choices and main-window bounds saves. New-window creation must still initialize native policy even when the default pin state is unchanged.
- CoreBox is a nonactivating macOS `NSPanel`. Its `setVisibleOnAllWorkspaces(true, { visibleOnFullScreen: true, skipTransformProcessType: true })` must retain the process-transform skip: Electron's default fullscreen handling invokes native `DockHide()` for the whole process, bypassing JavaScript `app.dock.hide()` instrumentation and disrupting the main window. Do not apply this exemption blindly to ordinary `BrowserWindow` instances.

---

## Testing Requirements

Choose the smallest meaningful verification for the slice:

- TuffEx component primitives: component-local Vitest tests plus focused lint/type checks when relevant.
- CoreApp renderer UI: nearest Vitest tests and `pnpm -C "apps/core-app" run typecheck:web` when the change touches renderer types.
- CoreApp main/transport/SDK surfaces: focused main/module tests and `pnpm -C "apps/core-app" run typecheck:node` when applicable.
- Plugins: plugin-local tests/build/lint when scripts exist, plus manifest validation for manifest changes.
- Nexus: focused route/component/build guard tests, `pnpm -C "apps/nexus" run typecheck`, and production preview evidence when the TODO requires it.
- Always run `git diff --check` before reporting completion.
- ESLint runs per workspace: `cd packages/tuffex && npx eslint <files>`, `cd apps/nexus && npx eslint <files>`. From the repo root every SFC fails to parse, which reads as a wall of errors unrelated to the change.
- A vue-tsc positive-control probe (one file with a deliberate type error) proves the run only if it sits inside the tsconfig `include` and its error shows up in the output. tuffex includes `packages/**` and excludes `__tests__`, so a probe at the package root is never compiled: put it at e.g. `packages/components/src/<component>/__tsc_probe__.ts` and delete it afterwards.
- Onboarding window-lifecycle changes: use an isolated profile to finish onboarding through both shortcut choices. Verify “keep exploring” preserves the primary window without summoning CoreBox; verify “hide and open CoreBox” hides it, then summon and hide CoreBox and confirm the primary window does not reappear.
- CoreBox pin/workspace regressions must cover initial unpinned creation, unchanged pin values through the real settings subscription, and genuine pin/unpin transitions. In isolated Electron, a bounds/config save with unchanged pin must cause zero workspace setter calls; CoreBox show/hide must preserve its floating, all-Spaces panel behavior without revealing the primary window.

Package-level recommended commands are listed in:

- `apps/core-app/AGENTS.md`
- `apps/nexus/AGENTS.md`
- `plugins/AGENTS.md`

---

## Evidence Boundaries

- R2 AI Stable visible evidence is governed by `docs/engineering/reports/coreapp-visible-ai-stable-2026-06-18/README.md` and its strict verifier.
- A visible-evidence claim about the current CoreApp version must run the strict verifier with `--requireCurrentVersion`; a historical 13/13 manifest may still prove its dated artifact snapshot, but it must not be relabeled as current packaged evidence when `baselineVersion` differs from `apps/core-app/package.json`.
- R3 Search / Indexing Runtime evidence is governed by `docs/plan-prd/TODO-R3.md` and `docs/engineering/reports/r3-indexing-runtime-2026-06-25/README.md`.
- Nexus performance and production conclusions are governed by `docs/plan-prd/TODO-nexus.md`.
- Governance production evidence must distinguish `live`, `d1`, `r2`, `local-only`, `memory`, and `open`.
- Isolated/controlled evidence can prove wiring, guardrails, or artifact collectors. It must not be rewritten as real-profile or production proof.

---

## Code Review Checklist

Reviewers should check:

- Does the change stay inside the owning package and task slice?
- Are interactive elements semantic, focusable, and keyboard accessible?
- Are plugin and host trust boundaries fail-closed?
- Are shared payloads typed in the owning package and normalized at runtime?
- Are secrets, paths, prompt/response content, and provider credentials kept out of ordinary logs/state/storage?
- Are i18n strings in the correct catalog or localized manifest path?
- Are tests focused on the changed behavior, and is any required evidence stronger than the test?
- Does `git diff --check` pass?

---

## Common Mistakes

- Treating "typecheck passed" as proof of user-visible Electron behavior.
- Treating local-only Nexus smoke as deployed Cloudflare production evidence.
- Pairing a verifier JSON from one run with screenshots or DOM from another run.
- Fixing a semantic control by adding ARIA to a `div` when a native button is available.
- Updating a shared payload in one package without updating SDK mirror tests.

---

## Scenario: Nexus Admin Inspection vs User Billing

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Apply when an administrative page reads service history also exposed through a paid user API.

### 2. Signatures

- Admin Analytics calls `GET /api/admin/exchange/history`; user clients retain `GET /api/exchange/history`.
- Both accept optional `target`, `since`, `until`, `limit`, `offset`, and `includePayload=true`.

### 3. Contracts

- Admin reads call `requireAdmin(event)` before parsing or querying; no subscription lookup or credit debit.
- History returns `{ base: 'USD', target, items, limit, offset }`; snapshots omit `target` and may include payload.
- Public history retains its non-FREE plan requirement, 2-credit charge, and admin-only payload access.
- Plan & Team displays personal usage when `permissions.canViewUsage` is true. Existing team credit endpoints scope personal data to the account and organization data to authorized members; client visibility never broadens server access.
- Personal consumption, remaining balance, and billing month use the scoped API totals. Failed initial requests must not render invented zero balances.
- Administrative subscription responses belong to one open drawer identity and request generation. Switching user/mode, closing/reopening, or unmounting invalidates old success, error, and loading updates.
- Credit usage, ledger, and trend responses belong to the current team ID, plan, permission context, and request generation. Team identity changes clear member filters and reset both paginators to page 1 before loading; stale organization responses cannot populate personal balances or ledgers.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Admin route: missing session → 401; inactive/non-admin account → 403; invalid currency or reversed time range → 400.
- Public route: FREE → 403; credit consumption failure → 402; non-admin raw payload access → 403.

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: a FREE admin inspects history with no debit; a FREE personal user sees their own monthly usage.
- Base: a paid user queries history and pays 2 credits.
- Bad: operational inspection requires purchasing a plan, or the UI invents a team pool for a personal account.

### 6. Tests Required

- `adminExchangeRateHistory.test.ts`: denied reads disclose nothing, accepted target/payload reads never bill, malformed queries fail.
- `exchangeRateHistory.test.ts`: FREE denial, paid-user charge, insufficient credits, and payload authorization remain protected.
- Browser smoke: real personal totals match the API, trends/ledger work, admin credits remain unchanged, and 390px layout does not overflow.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

- Wrong: Admin Analytics calls `/api/exchange/history` and inherits the user subscription/credit gate.
- Correct: Admin Analytics calls `/api/admin/exchange/history`, which authenticates current admin authority and only reads history.

---

## Scenario: Official Plugin Release Seed Integrity

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Apply this contract when changing Tuff plugin exporter staging, canonical official plugin builds, CoreApp packaged plugin seeds, runtime bootstrap, or release orchestration.
- Canonical source and version ownership stays under `plugins/<plugin>/`; `apps/core-app/resources/bundled-plugins/<plugin>/` is generated package input and Electron `Resources/bundled-plugins/<plugin>/` is immutable release payload.

### 2. Signatures

- Exporter internal classifier: `isGeneratedPackageOutputEntry(entryName: string): boolean`.
- Official build registry: `OFFICIAL_PLUGIN_BUILD_TARGETS: ReadonlyArray<{ packageName: string; pluginName: string }>`.
- Build orchestration: `buildOfficialPluginPackages(options?): string[]` returns the exact successful package build order.
- Cross-platform package command resolver: `resolvePnpmBuildInvocation(packageName, { platform?, comSpec? }): { executable: string; args: string[] }`.
- Single seed sync: `syncOfficialPluginBundledRuntime(pluginName, options?): SyncResult`.
- All-seed sync: `syncOfficialPluginBundledRuntimes(options?): SyncResult[]`.
- Packaged verifier: `verifyPackagedOfficialPluginSeeds(context): void`.
- Runtime bootstrap: `installBundledOfficialPluginSeeds({ seedRoot, runtimePluginRoot }): OfficialPluginSeedResult[]`; it is synchronous by contract.
- Marketplace status: `PluginVersionStatus` keeps `sdkapi`, `isCompatible`, and `isBundledManaged` separate; the reserved-name registry lives in `apps/core-app/src/shared/privileged-plugins.ts` and is shared by main and renderer.

### 3. Contracts

- Exporter staging must exclude top-level `out`, `build`, and case-insensitive `*.tpex` entries from source payload collection.
- Release order is CLI core, unplugin exporter, CLI entrypoint, TuffEx, every `OFFICIAL_PLUGIN_BUILD_TARGETS` package, every seed projection, plugin prelude bundling, CoreApp build/package, then after-pack seed verification. A clean checkout cannot assume any workspace `dist` output exists.
- `electron-vite build` or direct `electron-builder --dir` only packages the existing resource projection; it does not rebuild/synchronize canonical official plugin code. After any official plugin source/build change, release/evidence flow must run canonical plugin build + `syncOfficialPluginBundledRuntimes` before packaging.
- `apps/core-app` directly owns compatible `electron-builder` and `electron-builder-squirrel-windows` dev dependencies because `build-target.js` executes its package-local binary; do not rely on undeclared/transitive workspace hoisting.
- Release CI sets `ELECTRON_BUILDER_CACHE` to a `${{ github.workspace }}/..` sibling, never inside `${{ github.workspace }}`: downloaded CommonJS helper `.js` files must remain outside the root `type: module` package boundary.
- `electron-builder.yml` owns one top-level, filesystem-safe `executableName` for every platform; Linux must not derive it from the scoped CoreApp package name.
- Beta runtime, installer filename, and updater metadata versions remain the exact package `-beta.N` version on every platform; the preview no-publish policy must not rewrite Windows to `SNAPSHOT.N`.
- Nexus owns one asset per platform/architecture pair; GitHub backfill ranks platform defaults instead of preserving an arbitrary last-linked duplicate (`AppImage > deb > snap`, `dmg > zip`, versioned setup executable on Windows).
- Postprocessed macOS archives include canonical version and architecture (`tuff-<version>-<arch>.app.zip`); release-manifest inference and Nexus metadata must therefore report the actual arm64 build, and release notes list ZIP Apple Silicon rather than absent DMG/Intel artifacts.
- CoreApp lint ignores `resources/bundled-plugins/**`; these are synchronized immutable release payloads, and quality checks run against their canonical plugin sources instead of generated/minified projections.
- A successful projection result contains `pluginName`, `packageName`, `canonicalBuildRoot`, `bundledPluginRoot`, `canonicalVersion`, `synced: true`, and `skipped: false`.
- Packaged startup must finish seed validation/install into `<runtime-root>/modules/plugins` before `ModuleManager` construction; replacement preserves `data`/`logs`. Only non-privileged, identity-matching newer local runtimes may skip replacement; privileged runtimes are restored from the client seed.
- Dev startup runs the same installer before `ModuleManager` construction, reading the generated projection `apps/core-app/resources/bundled-plugins` (`app.getAppPath()/resources/bundled-plugins`) instead of `Resources/bundled-plugins`. Without it a dev profile never received a privileged plugin: the store refuses to install those names and nothing else put them there. The projection is only as fresh as its last `syncOfficialPluginBundledRuntimes`; a clean checkout carries only the committed projections, and a missing seed root is logged, not fatal.
- Store list/detail buttons must disable market install/upgrade for `isBundledManaged` and explain that the plugin updates with Tuff; an Official badge never bypasses the resolver's reserved-name gate. `useStoreInstall.handleInstall` checks the same policy before confirmation or download.
- Detail metadata reads SDK requirements from the catalog manifest, never README copy, and reports the actual host package version through `useEnv`/`AppSdk.getPackage` plus `CURRENT_SDK_VERSION`. `StartupInfo.version` can be `dev` and is not a release version. Missing catalog SDK metadata is explicitly unconfirmed, not evidence of compatibility; SDK failure and client-managed installation remain distinct, with full localized reasons outside ellipsized metadata values.
- `touch-browser-open` is a required `PLUGIN_RELEASE_TARGETS` bundled target, not a market-only plugin. Canonical build/sync and `verifyPackagedOfficialPluginSeeds` must include its `index.js`, settings page/SDK, and manifest payload hashes; reserving its privileged name while omitting the client seed leaves users with no supported installation path.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Unsupported plugin name -> `syncOfficialPluginBundledRuntime` throws.
- Missing canonical `dist/build`, `package.json`, or built `manifest.json` -> sync returns `reason: 'missing-canonical-build'`; release orchestration must throw.
- Built manifest name differs from registry plugin name -> throw canonical-build mismatch.
- Built manifest version differs from canonical package version -> throw canonical-build mismatch.
- Any prerequisite or plugin package build exits non-zero -> stop immediately; do not sync or package CoreApp.
- Missing TuffEx `dist/es/base.css` or component CSS before `touch-translation` build -> Vite resolution failure; build `@talex-touch/tuffex` before official plugin targets.
- Windows direct `execFileSync('pnpm.cmd', args)` under Node 24 -> fail with `spawnSync pnpm.cmd EINVAL`; resolve it through `ComSpec`/`cmd.exe /d /s /c pnpm.cmd` and preserve argument ordering.
- Missing `apps/core-app/node_modules/.bin/electron-builder` after a frozen install -> release packaging must fail before artifact claims; restore the direct CoreApp dependencies and lockfile rather than bypassing the lookup.
- Builder helper cache inside the repository -> Node 24 treats downloaded CommonJS `icon-tool.js` as ESM and rejects `require`; relocate the cache, do not patch downloaded files.
- Missing explicit Linux executable name with scoped package metadata -> AppImage rejects the derived `@talex-touchcore-app`; set the shared Builder `executableName`, do not un-scope the workspace package.
- Windows Builder `extraMetadata.version` rewritten from `beta.N` to `SNAPSHOT.N` -> published installer and `latest.yml` disagree with the release tag; package with the canonical beta version and fail the Windows artifact gate on any mismatch.
- Multiple GitHub Linux formats linked to one Nexus platform/architecture pair -> last-write order can leave Debian selected; backfill must rank AppImage above Debian rather than short-circuiting on the current exact filename.
- Unqualified `tuff.app.zip` from an arm64 macOS build -> manifest filename inference falls back to x64 and Nexus serves the wrong architecture metadata; encode version/arch in the archive filename.
- Static release notes advertise DMG/Intel macOS or ZIP Windows formats not present in the release -> update the download matrix to the actual packaging targets.
- Missing packaged seed, version mismatch, nested `dist`, or nested `.tpex` -> `afterPack` throws and packaging fails.
- Missing/empty/invalid runtime seed set -> runtime installer throws before mutating any plugin.
- Older, corrupt, wrong-identity, or same-version/different-signature local runtime -> staged clean replacement with rollback.
- Same-version canonical build differs from `apps/core-app/resources/bundled-plugins/<plugin>` -> treat the resource projection as stale even if after-pack version checks pass; synchronize content before packaging. Runtime same-version signature repair only helps when the packaged seed itself is current.
- Non-privileged, identity-matching newer local runtime -> return `newer-local` without mutation; privileged runtimes are restored from the immutable client seed.
- Privileged name in a regular package -> reserved-name rejection before runtime mutation; the marketplace disables the action and gives a localized client-update reason rather than exposing the raw backend text.

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: repeated builds keep only the current archive outside `dist/build`; packaged Resources contain two clean official seeds; a fresh profile discovers both during initial plugin loading.
- Base: a clean checkout builds CLI core, the unplugin exporter, the CLI entrypoint, TuffEx, and both official plugins; exporter `dist/vite.js` precedes the CLI build, TuffEx CSS precedes `touch-translation`, the CoreApp-local Builder binary exists, its helper cache stays outside the repository package boundary, every platform packages the explicit `tuff` executable with the canonical version, and Nexus selects the preferred format for each platform/architecture pair.
- Bad: copying the whole canonical `dist` directory, seeding after plugin discovery starts, or overwriting newer local runtime/data is prohibited.

### 6. Tests Required

- Both exporter implementations: seed a stale top-level `.tpex`, build, then assert absence from `dist/out`, `dist/build`, and `manifest._files`.
- Build orchestration: assert the exact CLI core -> exporter -> CLI entrypoint -> TuffEx -> official target order, and assert a failed build prevents later builds.
- Package command resolution: assert POSIX invokes `pnpm` directly and Windows invokes the configured `ComSpec` with `/d /s /c pnpm.cmd --filter <package> run build`.
- Release preflight: `pnpm -C apps/core-app exec electron-builder --version` must pass after a frozen install, then a package smoke must produce a real platform artifact.
- Workflow cache preflight: actionlint passes and `ELECTRON_BUILDER_CACHE` resolves to a sibling of `github.workspace`, not inside it.
- Linux package-name preflight: the unpacked executable is `tuff`, and a prepackaged AppImage build passes Builder's critical-path name validation before invoking the host-specific AppImage tool.
- Windows release artifact preflight: the setup filename and `latest.yml` version exactly equal `apps/core-app/package.json`.
- Nexus backfill preflight: a dry run against a release containing both AppImage and Debian candidates plans AppImage for the Linux/x64 pair.
- macOS release artifact preflight: postprocessing produces `tuff-<version>-arm64.app.zip`, the manifest/Nexus pair is `darwin/arm64`, and generated notes advertise ZIP Apple Silicon only.
- Lint preflight: run CoreApp lint with a cold/no-cache path and assert bundled plugin payloads are ignored while maintained CoreApp source remains covered.
- Seed projection and after-pack: assert clean stale-file removal, canonical version propagation, packaged resource presence, and fail-closed missing/mismatch/artifact behavior.
- Runtime bootstrap: assert immediate synchronous return, pre-mutation validation, clean install/update, data/log preservation, wrong-identity repair, and newer-local no-downgrade.
- Content freshness: compare canonical `dist/build` files with the bundled resource projection (excluding the resource-only package metadata where applicable), then verify a previously installed same-version/different-signature runtime is refreshed on startup.
- Release smoke: package CoreApp, inspect actual Resources, then launch a fresh isolated profile and assert both seeds are discovered during initial plugin loading.
- Marketplace smoke: a real catalog marker newer than the client shows required/current SDK, actual package version, incompatibility, and an upgrade hint; a supported marker shows compatibility and keeps ordinary installation enabled. A privileged entry independently shows client-managed installation with disabled controls. Existing resolver/dev-installer tests retain every reserved-name rejection and runtime-preservation assertion.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```js
// Wrong: packages whichever generated seed happens to be in resources.
execFileSync('pnpm.cmd', ['--filter', packageName, 'run', 'build'])
electronViteBuild()
electronBuilderDir()
startModuleManager()
```

#### Correct

```js
// Correct: canonical build and projection precede Electron packaging.
buildOfficialPluginPackages({
  projectRoot,
  workspaceRoot,
  runPackageBuild(packageName) {
    const { executable, args } = resolvePnpmBuildInvocation(packageName)
    execFileSync(executable, args)
  },
})
const results = syncOfficialPluginBundledRuntimes({
  projectRoot,
  workspaceRoot,
})
if (results.some(result => !result.synced)) throw new Error('Official plugin seed sync failed')
electronViteBuild()
electronBuilderDir()
installBundledOfficialPluginSeeds({ seedRoot, runtimePluginRoot })
startModuleManager()
```

## Scenario: Electron Main Singleton Cycle Safety

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Apply when an Electron main-process barrel exports both a service class/accessor and an eagerly constructed module singleton, and any dependency can reach that barrel again during module evaluation.

### 2. Signatures

- `getSentryService(): SentryServiceModule` returns the process singleton.
- `sentryModule: SentryServiceModule` is initialized only after the class and accessor declarations in `sentry-service.ts` have evaluated.
- `modules/sentry/module.ts` re-exports the initialized singleton; it does not construct a second instance.

### 3. Contracts

- Internal consumers continue importing `getSentryService` from the public `modules/sentry` barrel so Vitest mocks and the package boundary remain stable.
- The service implementation owns singleton creation after its class declaration. The barrel and compatibility module only re-export that binding.
- Controller extraction must not add a controller-to-facade import edge; inject facade-owned callbacks instead.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Singleton constructor runs before the class binding initializes -> production Electron throws `ReferenceError: Cannot access '<Service>' before initialization` during app load.
- Consumer bypasses the public barrel -> existing barrel mocks no longer isolate Electron-only dependencies in unit tests.
- Two files construct the singleton -> lifecycle registration, telemetry queues, and shutdown can diverge between instances.

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: an isolated Electron profile reaches `TouchApp runtime initialized` and the owning module's initialized log without a TDZ error.
- Base: production build, focused module tests, and an Electron startup smoke all pass with one singleton instance.
- Bad: `module.ts` imports the class and executes `new Service()` while the service dependency graph can re-enter the barrel.

### 6. Tests Required

- Focused lifecycle tests keep mocking the public barrel and must pass without importing Electron runtime APIs.
- `typecheck:node` and the CoreApp main/preload/renderer production build must pass.
- Launch the built main process with an isolated `--user-data-dir`; assert the owning module initializes and logs contain no TDZ or `App threw an error during load` failure.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
// module.ts can execute during a cycle before Service is initialized.
import { Service, setService } from './service'
export const serviceModule = new Service()
setService(serviceModule)
```

#### Correct

```ts
// service.ts, after the class and accessor declarations.
export const serviceModule = getService()

// module.ts
export { serviceModule } from './service'
```

## Scenario: Opaque Intelligence Caller Aggregation

### Scope

- Trigger: Intelligence audit logs are folded into day/month usage rows for quota enforcement and analytics.
- Canonical plugin callers contain `:` (`plugin:<manifest id>`); caller ids are opaque values, not delimiter-encoded tuples.

### Contract

- Preserve caller ids byte-for-byte through grouping and DB upsert.
- Use structured bucket fields for caller, period type, and period; never recover them with `split(":")`.
- Every audit contributes to exactly one day and one month bucket.
- Distinct callers such as `plugin:acme` and `plugin:acme:beta` remain distinct.
- Aggregate requests, success/failure, prompt/completion/total tokens, cost, and weighted latency exactly.
- `system` keeps system caller type; existing non-system callers keep plugin caller type.

### Validation

- Pure aggregation tests cover one-colon and multi-colon callers, system, separate buckets, totals, and weighted latency.
- Focused diagnostics and lint must pass.
- Quota code must query the same opaque caller id/caller type written by aggregation.

### Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
const [caller, periodType, period] = key.split(':')
```

#### Correct

```ts
for (const { callerId, callerType, periodType, period, summary } of buckets) {
  // persist structured fields directly
}
```

## Scenario: Local Knowledge Context Budget Integrity

### Scope

- Trigger: changing local-knowledge search results, Context Builder packing, chunk token estimates, or retrieval metadata.
- The host-owned `tokenBudget` is a hard upper bound for complete indexed chunks, not a target that the first result may exceed.

### Contract

- Skip every candidate whose addition would make aggregate `tokenEstimate` exceed the normalized budget, including the first candidate.
- Continue scanning after an oversized candidate so later smaller hits remain eligible.
- Do not truncate chunk content during packing; chunk identity, citation, and indexed text stay aligned.
- If search is `ok` with hits but no complete chunk fits, return `degraded` with `degradedReason: "token-budget-exhausted"`, empty context/chunks/citations, and zero token estimate.
- A genuine zero-hit search remains an `ok` empty result. Preserve upstream unavailable/degraded reasons.
- Use the shared host-owned conservative estimator for ContextHygiene and local knowledge. Count contiguous ASCII runs as `ceil(codePoints / 4)`, each non-ASCII code point as at least one, and emoji more conservatively; do not reintroduce per-service UTF-16 `length / 4` copies.
- Re-evaluate persisted turn/chunk content when mapping rows and expose `max(storedEstimate, currentContentEstimate)`. This is a read-time budget guard, not a SQLite rewrite.
- Treat the result as tokenizer-independent budget governance only. Never document or bill it as an exact provider/model token count.
- Allow aggregate overflow only through an explicit normal `current_input` admission. Never derive the exception from `items.length`, because a privacy-blocked current turn would transfer it to the first optional summary/turn/memory/retrieval item.
- Normalize runtime token budgets before arithmetic: accept only finite numbers, floor and clamp them to at least 1, use the service's finite fallback for every other value, and never coerce numeric strings. ContextHygiene falls back to 1,600; local knowledge fails closed to 1.
- Apply the same normalizer to storage-degraded `IntelligenceContextExecutionSummary` and Provider options metadata; the fallback path must never reintroduce `NaN`, infinity, or string coercion.

### Validation

- Focused tests put an oversized hit before a smaller hit and assert only the fitting hit and citation are returned within budget.
- Focused tests make every hit oversized and assert the explicit empty degraded result without leaked chunk text.
- Pure estimator tests cover whitespace, ASCII boundaries, CJK, emoji/ZWJ sequences, and mixed text.
- Legacy-row regressions store a low CJK estimate, prove current content controls packing/package totals, and prove no update rewrites the historical row.
- A privacy regression excludes a secret current input, presents an oversized safe legacy summary as the first optional source, and asserts empty package content plus metadata-only privacy/budget exclusions. A companion case keeps an oversized normal current input while pruning the optional summary.
- Normalization regressions cover fractions, zero/negative, omitted/null/string, `NaN`, and both infinities; service tests assert finite persisted/returned budgets and fail-closed knowledge packing.
- Degraded-summary regressions force preparation failure and assert malformed budgets become finite 1,600 in both the returned summary and Provider invocation metadata; a valid fraction still floors.
- Existing dedupe, `maxChunks`, filtering, FTS failure, lint, and node type-check coverage must remain green.

### Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
if (nextEstimate > budget && selected.length > 0) continue
```

#### Correct

```ts
if (nextEstimate > budget) continue
```

## Scenario: Voice Dock Display Recovery

The Assistant floating ball this scenario used to cover was removed on 2026-10-08; its saved
position, default placement and bounds clamping went with it. What remains is how the dictation
HUD (the voice dock) follows display changes.

### Scope

- Trigger: changing how the voice dock window follows display topology or picks its display.

### Contract

- After successful module initialization, register one shared handler for `display-added`, `display-removed`, and `display-metrics-changed`; remove that exact handler during teardown.
- Display events must not create Assistant windows.
- Reanchor only a visible, expanded dock to the bottom centre of the recovered work area, without show, focus, or `panelOpened` broadcast side effects. A hidden dock is left alone.

### Validation

- Focused lifecycle tests assert all three listeners share handler identity and teardown removes them.
- Focused recovery tests assert visible and hidden dock behavior without focus, show or broadcast side effects.
- Main-process lint and node type-check must pass.
- Code/focused tests do not replace real multi-display/HiDPI or current-version packaged evidence.

## Scenario: Mode-Isolated Renderer Surface Loading

### Scope

- Trigger: changing `AppEntrance.vue` or another renderer entry shared by mutually exclusive Electron window modes.
- Static SFC imports enter the shared startup graph even when the active window mode can never render that surface.

### Contract

- Mode-exclusive Assistant surfaces use named `defineAsyncComponent(() => import(exactPath))` declarations; do not keep a static import of the same SFC.
- Preserve template branch order, component tags, startup mode logging, and the behavior inside each surface.
- Do not lazy-load latency-critical CoreBox/DivisionBox or unrelated window modes as part of an Assistant-only isolation change.
- Do not add a loading overlay, remote fetch, preload bridge, duplicate registry, or dependency solely to split the chunk.

### Validation

- A focused source contract rejects static imports for each exact mode-exclusive path and requires its named dynamic declaration.
- Run web type-check and targeted lint.
- Run the production renderer build and confirm distinct JavaScript chunks for each surface; a source assertion alone does not prove Rollup output.
- Chunk presence proves isolation wiring, not measured startup latency, packaged install-size reduction, or current-version visual evidence.

### Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
import VoicePanel from './views/assistant/VoicePanel.vue'
```

#### Correct

```ts
const VoicePanel = defineAsyncComponent(() => import('./views/assistant/VoicePanel.vue'))
```

## Scenario: Context Execution Degraded Secret Fallback

### Scope

- Trigger: changing host-owned `contextInvoke` / `contextStream`, ContextHygiene preparation, storage-degraded fallbacks, or current-only Provider payloads.
- The availability fallback runs before durable privacy classification can be guaranteed, so it must enforce the same synchronous host secret policy itself.

### Contract

- Reuse the ContextHygiene classifier. Never copy its regex list into ContextExecution.
- Classify raw input before constructing a degraded current-only payload. Unsafe input throws stable `CONTEXT_CURRENT_INPUT_POLICY_BLOCKED` for invoke and stream.
- Do not call the Provider, append an assistant turn, or include raw secret content in errors, logs, summaries, audit metadata, or recovery detail.
- Safe input keeps the existing `context_prepare_failed` current-only fallback and caller/governance metadata.

### Validation

- Force preparation to fail before classification, then assert secret-bearing invoke and stream requests both reject and their Provider methods remain untouched.
- Assert the surfaced error is stable and contains no secret value; retain the safe degraded-fallback regression.

### Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
catch {
  return assembler.currentOnly(request)
}
```

#### Correct

```ts
catch {
  if (!isContextInputProviderSafe(request.input))
    throw new Error('CONTEXT_CURRENT_INPUT_POLICY_BLOCKED')
  return assembler.currentOnly(request)
}
```

## Scenario: Monotonic Context Privacy Classification

### Scope

- Trigger: changing `PrepareContextTurnInput.privacyLevel`, secret detection, turn persistence, redaction, or ContextPackage current-input admission.
- A caller privacy hint may make safe content more private; it must never downgrade content the host classifies as secret.

### Contract

- Run host secret detection before honoring the caller hint. Detected secret always resolves to `privacyLevel: "secret"` regardless of explicit `normal` or `private`.
- Redact secret content before SQLite writes and exclude it from ContextPackage with `secret-policy-blocked` metadata-only evidence.
- Never include the raw secret in turn results, package logs, metadata, errors, or audit data.
- Preserve explicit `private` for safe content, including canonical redaction and `private-policy-blocked` exclusion.
- Keep one shared classifier for normal persistence and degraded Provider fallback. It must recognize credential-like `Bearer` values (at least 16 standard token characters) and JSON-looking three-segment JWTs.
- Preserve bounded false-positive behavior: short placeholders such as `Bearer token` / `Bearer <token>` and generic dotted text such as `foo.bar.baz` remain safe.

### Validation

- Table-test explicit normal/private hints on secret-bearing input and assert secret classification, redacted persistence, exclusion, and raw-value absence across every serialized payload.
- Keep a safe explicit-private control so the fix cannot erase valid caller privacy intent.
- Credential classifier tests exercise realistic synthetic Bearer/JWT values through MemoryPolicy, turn persistence/package logging, and degraded invoke/stream; assert Provider isolation and raw-value absence.
- Pair every expanded credential pattern with explicit placeholder/non-secret controls.

### Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
const privacyLevel = input.privacyLevel ?? (containsSecret(input.input) ? 'secret' : 'normal')
```

#### Correct

```ts
const privacyLevel = containsSecret(input.input) ? 'secret' : (input.privacyLevel ?? 'normal')
```

## Scenario: Ollama NDJSON Stream Integrity

### Scope

- Trigger: changing `LocalProvider.chatStream()`, NetworkService stream chunk conversion, Ollama NDJSON framing, or terminal usage mapping.
- Node transport chunks and UTF-8 code points are independent boundaries; neither may be treated as a complete string or JSON frame.

### Contract

- Use one stateful UTF-8 decoder for the entire response. Convert Buffer/Uint8Array/string adapter chunks to bytes before decoder writes and flush it exactly once at EOF.
- Keep an independent newline buffer for Ollama NDJSON. Parse only complete lines during streaming, then process the final buffered line after decoder flush.
- A final `done: true` line without trailing newline emits any content delta followed by exactly one terminal chunk carrying Ollama prompt/completion/total usage.
- If Ollama omits `done`, emit one synthetic terminal chunk after all buffered text. Preserve the existing newline-terminated done and typed pre-output HTTP 404 compatibility fallback.
- Treat the first non-empty Ollama delta as the provider-internal compatibility commit point. Compatibility fallback requires `NetworkHttpStatusError.status === 404` before that point; arbitrary parser/transport messages containing `404` and post-delta typed 404s propagate unchanged without fallback deltas or synthetic success.
- A valid Ollama `{ error: ... }` protocol frame is projected to a stable `MODEL_UNSUPPORTED` or `OLLAMA_REQUEST_FAILED` error with identical fixed code/message. The original body must not be retained in the Error property graph, cause, response data, logs, or evidence. Apply the same projection to newline-delimited and final buffered frames, before or after a delta; a post-delta frame never triggers compatibility fallback.
- Do not claim built-in llama.cpp/GGUF management from this compatibility path; runtime binaries, model lifecycle UI, packaging, and device smoke need separate evidence.

### Validation

- Split synthetic Chinese and emoji bytes inside code points and split NDJSON at different boundaries; assert exact ordered text and no replacement character.
- End a usage-bearing done frame without `\n`; assert final delta, exact usage, and a single done chunk.
- Keep focused non-stream chat, model discovery, OCR, and 404 fallback coverage green.
- Cover all sides of fallback classification: typed pre-output HTTP 404 returns compatibility chunks; a generic error message containing `404` propagates unchanged; post-delta typed 404 returns the original error, never calls compatibility, and emits no second-backend/done chunk.
- Cover generic and unsupported Ollama error frames, including a final frame without `\n` and a frame after a delta; assert stable classification, full Error-graph redaction, and no compatibility fallback after output.

### Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
buffer += chunk.toString('utf8')
```

#### Correct

```ts
buffer += decoder.write(toStreamBuffer(chunk))
// EOF: buffer += decoder.end()
```

## Scenario: Network Stream Cooldown Settlement

### Scope

- Trigger: changing `NetworkService.requestStream()`, stream transport conversion, cooldown/retry policy, or an AI provider that consumes the returned body.
- A successful HTTP response object proves only that the stream opened; it does not prove the body completed.

### Contract

- Preserve fetch/open retry and HTTP status behavior. Do not retry a body failure after the stream has been handed to a consumer because visible bytes may already exist.
- Defer guard success until the Node readable emits normal `end`. Apply the configured `autoResetOnSuccess` only then.
- Record a readable `error` as exactly one guard failure and leave the same error observable to async iteration.
- Treat early `close` without `end` or `error` as consumer cancellation: record neither success nor failure, so prior guard state remains unchanged.
- Remove lifecycle listeners after the first terminal event and make policy settlement idempotent.

### Validation

- Prime one failure under `failureThreshold: 2`; opening an unconsumed stream must not reset it.
- After one prior failure, yield a body chunk and then error; the consumer receives the error and the next same-key request is blocked without another fetch.
- Fully consume a body and prove a later single failure does not activate threshold-two cooldown.
- Destroy a stream early and prove the next failure is executed, then the following request is blocked: cancellation added no failure and cleared none.
- Keep LocalProvider UTF-8/framing/fallback regressions green; downstream parser errors are provider failures, not transport body errors.

### Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
const result = await openStream()
guard.recordSuccess(key)
return result
```

#### Correct

```ts
stream.once('end', settleSuccess)
stream.once('error', settleFailure)
stream.once('close', cleanupWithoutSettlement)
```

## Scenario: Usage Statistics Single-Writer Integrity

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing CoreBox usage logging, `UsageStatsQueue`, periodic usage maintenance, `item_usage_stats`, `usage_summary`, or a migration that repairs ranking/recommendation counters.
- `item_usage_stats` is provider-keyed personalization state. Replaying a source-type-only log into it creates a second identity and can repeatedly amplify ranking signals.

### 2. Signatures

```ts
UsageStatsQueue.enqueue(
  sourceId: string,
  itemId: string,
  sourceType: string,
  type: 'search' | 'execute' | 'cancel'
): void

DbUtils.incrementUsageStats(
  sourceId: string,
  itemId: string,
  sourceType: string,
  type: 'search' | 'execute' | 'cancel'
): Promise<unknown>
```

- `item_usage_stats` identity: `(source_id, item_id)` where `source_id = TuffItem.source.id`.
- `usage_logs.source` is legacy source type, not provider id.
- `usage_summary(item_id, click_count)` is item-level execution evidence and has no source identity.

### 3. Contracts

- `UsageStatsQueue` is the normal incremental writer of `item_usage_stats`; `DbUtils.incrementUsageStats()` is the initialization fallback. One event reaches exactly one of them.
- Periodic maintenance may overwrite derived `item_time_stats` and remove expired logs, but must never additively replay `usage_logs` into `item_usage_stats`.
- Never infer `source_id` from `usage_logs.source` or copy source type into both source columns.
- Conservative repair may delete `source_id = source_type` only when a different provider-keyed sibling exists for the same item/source type.
- `usage_summary.click_count` may only lower a provable execute over-count. It must not raise an under-count or synthesize a provider id.
- Repair preserves search/cancel counts and timestamps, runs through the journaled libSQL migration transaction, and is idempotent.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Provider-aware sibling exists for a source-type row -> delete only the source-type row.
- Provider id legitimately equals source type and no sibling exists -> keep the row; cap execute count only when a matching summary proves over-count.
- `execute_count > click_count` with matching summary -> lower to `click_count`.
- `execute_count <= click_count` -> leave unchanged.
- No matching summary -> leave unchanged.
- Any migration statement fails -> libSQL migration transaction rolls back data and journal insert.

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: one execute writes log + item summary + provider-aware queue increment; later maintenance changes no item counter.
- Base: queue unavailable during initialization, so the direct fallback increments once.
- Bad: scan every retained execution log on each startup and upsert `source_id = source_type` with additive counts.
- Bad: clear all personalization or guess a provider id to make historical rows look canonical.

### 6. Tests Required

- Temporary-libSQL migration test covers phantom sibling deletion, id-equals-type capping, under-count/no-summary preservation, unrelated fields, and second-run idempotence.
- Maintenance service test seeds an execution log plus provider-aware item stats, runs maintenance, asserts item stats are unchanged, and asserts time stats still rebuild.
- Usage recording contract asserts queue and fallback are mutually exclusive for one event.
- CoreApp node type-check and a direct temporary-database execute/flush/maintenance/reread smoke must pass.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
const sourceId = usageLog.source // source type, not provider id
executeCount = sql`${itemUsageStats.executeCount} + ${replayedCount}`
```

#### Correct

```ts
usageStatsQueue.enqueue(item.source.id, item.id, item.source.type, 'execute')
// Periodic maintenance does not write item_usage_stats.
```

## Scenario: Nexus Sync Batch Atomicity

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing Nexus sync push validation, conflict resolution, oplog/materialized item writes, quota accounting, or session cursors.
- The protected tables are `sync_oplog_v1`, `sync_items_v1`, `sync_quotas_v1`, and `sync_sessions_v1`.

### 2. Contracts

- Validate the complete request before issuing any sync write.
- Preload item ids and operation sequences in bounded batches; per-item awaited D1 reads/writes are prohibited on the push path.
- Last-writer-wins order is `updated_at`, then lexicographically greater `device_id`; an existing null device id yields on an equal timestamp.
- `(user_id, device_id, op_seq)` remains the idempotency identity. Duplicate sequences apply at most the first accepted operation.
- Oplog, materialized item, authoritative live quota, and push-session cursor updates execute in one D1 `batch()` transaction.
- Every serialized JSON binding stays below the configured chunk limit, and the request reserves headroom below D1's invocation query limit before starting the write batch.
- Tombstones retain stored payload size but contribute neither storage nor object count to live quota.
- The push route must not apply a second quota delta after the transactional service returns.

### 3. Validation & Error Matrix

- Known oplog sequence -> no duplicate materialization or quota change.
- Older timestamp, or equal timestamp with lower/equal device id -> conflict; no oplog/item write.
- Equal timestamp with null existing device -> candidate wins and both oplog/item update.
- Any statement fails -> oplog, item, quota, and session remain at their pre-batch values.
- Planned statement count exceeds the guarded budget -> reject before write.
- Quota reconciliation exceeds a NOT NULL limit guard -> the D1 transaction rolls back.

### 4. Tests Required

- Focused tests cover more than 1,000 items, duplicate sequences, timestamp/device ties, update/delete/tombstone accounting, handshake/pull, and failure after all mutation classes have run.
- A local D1/Miniflare smoke proves the exact bulk SQL and transaction behavior.
- A roadmap item that explicitly requires real D1 evidence must use isolated Preview D1 tables after explicit approval, verify success and rollback, and prove cleanup; local-only evidence cannot replace it.

## Scenario: File Filtering Boundary Integrity

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing file scan traversal, file-index writes, native file Providers, semantic recall, recommendation/cache results, or `search.update` publication.
- The policy owner is `packages/utils/common/file-filter-service.ts`; main-process and Worker callers must not define private blacklist copies.

### 2. Signatures

```ts
fileFilterService.getTraversalExclusionReason(path, options)
fileFilterService.getIndexExclusionReason(target, options)
fileFilterService.getManualIndexExclusionReason(target)
fileFilterService.getSearchExclusionReason(target)
fileFilterService.filterSearchItems(items)
```

### 3. Contracts

- Provider/scanner filtering before local limits, `stat`, icons, thumbnails, FTS, and embeddings is an optimization boundary.
- File-index persistence and search-result publication are mandatory correctness boundaries and must evaluate the shared policy even when the producer filtered early.
- Provider result counts, source stats, ranking, cache entries, and frontend limits use the filtered result set.
- Filesystem path identity is canonical when backend `name` / `extension` metadata disagrees with the path.
- Manual indexing may bypass unsupported extensions, but not hidden metadata, internal databases, temporary files, or bundle interiors.
- Search visibility does not reuse the complete auto-index blacklist: ordinary `.zip` and image files, native directories, and explicit user artifacts remain visible.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- `.itdb` / `.tvdb` / `.localized`, metadata names, or media-bundle interior -> reject before index and publication.
- Provider forgets early filtering -> publication gate still rejects and decrements result/source counts.
- Full scan or reconciliation submits a non-whitelisted/noise record -> index commit gate rejects before side effects.
- Stale DB/embedding/cache/recommendation row -> read/outbound gate hides it; reconciliation may remove the persisted row later.
- Missing `meta.file.path` or virtual Shell item -> preserve; do not classify it as filesystem noise.
- `.zip`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp` -> preserve.

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: Spotlight filters `Music Library.musiclibrary/Genius.itdb` before `stat`; Gather filters again before `resultCount`.
- Base: `WeTypeInstaller_3000.zip` and `Screenshot.png` pass scanner, Provider, ranking, cache, and UI publication.
- Bad: a Provider-local `.filter(...)` is the only guard, or filtering occurs after `.slice(limit)` and lets noise starve valid results.

### 6. Tests Required

- Shared policy matrix covers internal databases, localization markers, bundle interiors, normal archives/images, manual indexing, and virtual items.
- Full-scan regression proves noise is absent while user files remain.
- Spotlight/Linux/Everything regressions assert filtering precedes local limits and expensive metadata work.
- Gather regression asserts filtered items do not contribute to update totals or source `resultCount`.
- Indexed keyword/type/extension and semantic-recall paths exercise the same stale-row filter.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
const items = (await provider.onSearch(query, signal)).items
publish(items.slice(0, 50)) // provider opt-in and late filtering
```

#### Correct

```ts
const backendItems = filterEarly(await provider.onSearch(query, signal))
const visibleItems = fileFilterService.filterSearchItems(backendItems)
recordProviderCount(visibleItems.length)
publish(visibleItems.slice(0, 50))
```

## Scenario: App/File Search Index Single-Writer Atomicity

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing AppProvider/FileProvider searchable mutations, `IndexingRuntime`, `SearchIndexStoreAdapter`, SearchIndex worker messages, shared-index DDL, migration preflight/evidence verification, source reset/rebuild, enrichment scheduling, or SearchCore teardown.
- Producer databases are source-local state. Every mutation of shared `search_index`, `keyword_mappings`, and `search_index_meta` enters `IndexingRuntime` and the selected `SourceScopedIndexWriterRouter`; Providers never call the shared writer/client/service directly.

### 2. Signatures

```ts
IndexingRuntime.applySourceBatch(batch: IndexedSourceRecordBatch)
IndexingRuntime.applySourceDelta(delta: IndexedSourceDelta)
IndexingRuntime.resetSourceRuntimeState(sourceId, request)
IndexingRuntime.abortAndDrainSourceScans(sourceId)

IndexStoreAdapter.beginSourceReplacement(sourceId)
IndexStoreAdapter.stageSourceReplacement(session, records)
IndexStoreAdapter.commitSourceReplacement(session, totals)
IndexStoreAdapter.abortSourceReplacement(session)

IndexedWorkerScheduleBatch.scopeId?: string
IndexedSourceRecordBatch.mutationLeaseId?: string
IndexedSourceDelta.mutationLeaseId?: string
```

- `search_index_replacement_stage(replacement_id, provider_id, sequence, document)` stores bounded candidate batches; readers never query it.
- `SearchIndexService.applyProviderItems(providerId, items, legacyItemIds)` atomically retires provider-scoped legacy IDs and inserts their replacements.

- Persistent shared-index DDL, including `idx_keyword_mappings_keyword` and provider-scoped keyword indexes, runs only from writer-mode `SearchIndexService` initialization before provider scans begin.
- `IndexedSourceTaskHistoryEntry` scan records expose both `reason` (the semantic scan reason) and `trigger` (the initiating request/caller reason) when available.

### 3. Contracts

- Runtime assigns one mutation lease per source operation. Base store application and every accepted File enrichment continuation carry that lease; `source.drainMutations({ leaseId })` settles the same scope before lease release.
- Different normal leases may run concurrently. A scoped drain consumes only its own timers, dispatches, and failures; it cannot make another scope succeed or fail.
- Exact replacement scans are streamed into staging. The old provider snapshot remains visible until one SQLite commit deletes the old rows and inserts the complete candidate; scan/stage/commit failure aborts staging and preserves the old snapshot.
- Incremental ID migration removes legacy IDs and inserts the new provider document in one transaction. Unscoped delete/index pairs and unscoped `removeItems` are prohibited.
- Counts are observed results: removed rows come from SQLite/worker summaries, indexed rows come from the commit, and skipped delete misses report `applied: false` with zero removed rows.
- A worker batch with `failed > 0`, dispatch rejection, flush timeout, or expired lease fails the initiating Runtime task and clears source scan progress for retry. Logging a warning is not success.
- SearchCore aborts and drains active App source scans and prepares FileProvider shutdown before clearing Runtime delegates or stopping the SearchIndex writer.
- `files` stores App and File producer rows together; real-profile parity compares `search_index.provider = 'file-provider'` with `files.type = 'file'` (and App with `files.type = 'app'`), never with the unfiltered table count.
- A source-scoped `scan_progress` profile may legitimately produce `plan.status = 'not-needed'`, `requiresApproval = false`, and copy-simulation `execution.executed = false`. Evidence verification treats that as a successful no-op only when the source snapshot is unchanged and the post-plan is still `not-needed`.
- Packaged maintenance evidence requires a successful typed scan task plus visible `duration`, `reason`, and `trigger`; seeded or failed task history cannot be relabeled as successful packaged indexing evidence.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Provider/source mismatch in a staged or incremental candidate -> reject before visibility changes.
- Candidate scan/stage failure -> abort staging; old searchable rows remain.
- Commit statement failure -> SQLite rollback restores old rows; caller receives failure.
- Legacy removal succeeds but replacement insert fails -> the combined transaction rolls back both.
- Worker returns `{ failed: n }`, `n > 0` -> scoped drain rejects; task history is failed, never succeeded.
- Healthy scope drains beside a failed scope -> healthy resolves; failed scope retains its own `AggregateError`.
- Reset hook fails -> no shared replacement commit; reset result contains `error`.
- App scan is active during destroy -> abort iterator, await provider `return()`/finally, then shut down writer.
- Provider executes `CREATE INDEX` on a shared table -> ownership violation and possible startup `SQLITE_BUSY`; move the DDL to writer initialization rather than adding a Provider retry.
- Real-profile preflight compares one provider with all shared `files` rows -> false parity failure; scope the durable row count by producer type.
- Already migrated `scan_progress` returns a no-op copy simulation -> pass only the explicit `not-needed` contract; do not force or fake an execute-mode migration.
- Successful packaged scan omits `reason` from task history -> diagnostics evidence fails even when the scan itself succeeds.

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: File scan publishes base batches under lease `L`; writer acknowledges; enrichment jobs/results retain `L`; drain `L` completes; Runtime releases `L`.
- Base: a provider-scoped delete finds no row and returns an observable skipped summary without mutating another provider that shares the item ID.
- Good: rebuild stages 100 bounded batches while searches still see snapshot A, then one commit exposes snapshot B.
- Bad: `removeByProvider()` followed by batch indexing, direct Provider calls to SearchIndexWorkerClient, a fire-and-forget enrichment Promise, or a global failure queue consumed by the first concurrent drain.

### 6. Tests Required

- Real temporary-libSQL tests prove staged visibility, abort preservation, commit rollback, provider-scoped clear counts, and atomic legacy-ID migration rollback.
- Runtime tests prove staged reset/switch ordering, terminal snapshot enforcement, same-lease scan/watch/reconcile drain, and public scan abort/drain.
- Scheduler tests prove scoped failure attribution and scoped deferred cancellation in both drain orders.
- App tests cover UWP stable ID continuity, Runtime delta routing, local reset versus public Runtime rebuild, and early iterator return.
- File tests cover bounded streaming, terminal batches, worker `failed` summaries, lease propagation through worker results, scoped drain, and scan-progress recovery.
- SearchCore destroy tests prove App/File drain completes before writer shutdown. CoreApp node type-check and the focused App/File/search-engine suites must pass.
- Real-profile closure uses query-only preflight/plan plus copy-execute simulations. Assert correlated database identity, source snapshot/checksum unchanged, source-scoped row parity, no blockers, and retained legacy `file_fts`.
- Rebuild the unpacked packaged app after main/shared source changes, run the isolated fixture-root diagnostics probe, and assert scan success plus visible `duration`, `reason`, and `trigger` artifacts.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
await searchIndex.removeByProvider(sourceId)
void worker.indexFiles(files)
await searchIndex.indexItems(nextItems)
return { success: true }
```

#### Correct

```ts
return sourceMutationGate.run(sourceId, async lease => {
  await runtime.applySourceBatch({ ...batch, mutationLeaseId: lease.id })
  await source.drainMutations?.({ leaseId: lease.id, reason: 'scan' })
})
```

#### Wrong: Provider-owned shared DDL and unscoped evidence

```ts
await providerDb.run(sql`CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_keyword_mappings_keyword ON keyword_mappings(keyword)`)
const parity = sourceIndexedRows === allFilesRows
```

#### Correct: Writer-owned DDL and source-scoped evidence

```ts
await searchIndexWriter.initialize(databasePath)
const sourceFilesRows = await countFilesByType('file')
const parity = sourceIndexedRows === sourceFilesRows
```

## Scenario: Operational Error Privacy and SQLite Rebuild Recovery

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Apply when an Electron main/renderer/worker/plugin-host failure crosses transport, reaches UI, enters Sentry/Nexus, or exhausts SQLite retries.
- The original `Error` is diagnostic state, not a transport payload. Every business boundary must choose a stable classification and an explicit public result.

### 2. Signatures

- Shared input: `OperationalErrorInput { domain, operation, error, code?, severity?, retryable?, userImpact?, context?, publicMessage?, dedupeWindowMs?, captureDetail? }`.
- Shared result: `OperationalErrorReport { id, domain, operation, code, severity, retryable, userImpact, publicMessage, occurredAt, occurrenceCount, context }`.
- Main facade: `operationalErrorService.report(input): OperationalErrorReport`.
- SQLite observer: `setSqliteRetryExhaustedListener(listener | null): () => void`; `SqliteRetryExhaustedEvent` contains `label`, `attempts`, `elapsedMs`, optional `code/rawCode`, and the original `error`.
- File rebuild transport: `FileIndexRebuildResult { success, errorCode?, retryable?, reportId?, requiresConfirm?, reason?, battery?, threshold? }`; raw `error`/`message` fields are prohibited.
- Worker-owned metadata update: `FilePersistencePort.updateFileMetadata(records: FileMetadataUpdateRecord[]): Promise<FileMetadataUpdateSummary>`; the summary is `{ requested, updated, missingFileIds }`.
- `FileMetadataUpdateRecord` contains `{ id, name, extension, size, mtime, ctime, lastIndexedAt, isDir, type }` and never carries `path`.
- File index status transport: `FileIndexStatus { ..., errorCode?, retryable?, reportId?, startupErrorCode? }`; raw `error`/`startupError` fields are prohibited.
- Failed-file transport: `FileIndexFailedFilesResult { files: [{ fileId, fileName, errorCode, updatedAt }], errorCode?, retryable?, reportId? }`; only basename and stable code cross.

### 3. Contracts

- Main business code depends on the operational facade, never directly on the Sentry SDK. Detail and aggregate sinks are injected and best-effort.
- Local logs keep reportId plus the complete Error stack and bounded `cause` chain. Transport/UI/Nexus never receive raw message, SQL, params, absolute paths, search text, clipboard content, or payload data.
- Sentry receives a stable `operational/<domain>/<operation>/<code>` fingerprint, stable tags, allowlisted primitive context, and a sanitized stack. Nexus receives only category/count and safe numeric health fields.
- `publicMessage` must be caller-provided safe copy or the facade's generic fallback; it must never fall back to `error.message`.
- The dedupe key is stable `domain + operation + code`. Sink failure, disabled Sentry, or pre-init buffering must not alter the business result. Pre-init detail buffering and dedupe state stay bounded.
- SQLite retry exhaustion is observed once below business code. The low-level observer emits local/aggregate evidence; a user-blocking boundary may separately emit one deduped detail event with a business code.
- A file rebuild pauses writer admission, drains active/pending writes, performs only local progress reset inside the pause, resumes in `finally`, then runs writer-backed snapshot rebuild outside the pause. The local reset uses `interactive` priority and `dropPolicy:none`.
- File metadata refresh never executes main-process `UPDATE files`; FileProvider sends bounded chunks through `FilePersistencePort`, and the search-index worker owns the `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction and retry.
- Validate the complete metadata batch before SQL: at most 100 rows, unique positive integer IDs, valid dates, nonnegative finite/null size, boolean `isDir`, and nonempty `type`. Missing IDs are reported and skipped; they are never resurrected by path.
- Public File Index projectors rebuild exact allowlisted objects. `errorCode` is an uppercase identifier, report IDs and progress/estimate fields are bounded stable tokens, failed-file timestamps are canonical ISO, and both new `fileName` and legacy `path` inputs are reduced to basename.
- File Index dashboard entries, watched roots, scan progress, worker `lastError`, and task `error` pass through a main-process projector before `tuff:dashboard`; the renderer receives basenames and stable codes only.
- Renderer catches may branch on projected code fields, but must never inspect `Error.message` or pass a caught `Error`/transport payload to console or renderer loggers.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- SQLite busy exhaustion during file rebuild -> `success=false`, `errorCode=FILE_INDEX_DATABASE_BUSY`, `retryable=true`, safe localized UI; local log retains the raw cause.
- Writer admission/drain timeout -> `FILE_INDEX_WRITER_DRAIN_TIMEOUT`, `retryable=true`; admission still resumes in `finally`.
- Unknown rebuild I/O failure -> stable generic rebuild code, `retryable=false` unless explicitly classified, no raw message in transport.
- Battery, initialization, missing-context, cancel, permission denial, and offline expected outcomes -> explicit business result; no Sentry detail exception by default.
- Sentry disabled/uninitialized/rejected -> same business result and local report; no recursive reporter call.
- Sensitive or dynamic context key/value -> omit it from remote report rather than renaming or stringifying it.
- Metadata batch exceeds 100, repeats an ID, contains an invalid date, or has negative/non-finite size -> `FILE_INDEX_METADATA_INVALID` before SQL; existing rows remain unchanged.
- Metadata ID does not exist -> add it to `missingFileIds`, do not insert/upsert a row, and continue the transaction.
- Second connection holds `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` -> retry under `search-index.worker.updateFileMetadata`; exhaustion maps publicly to `FILE_INDEX_DATABASE_BUSY`, and releasing the lock lets the repository recover.
- Malformed transport puts SQL, params, path, stack, or cause into any public code/report/stage/status/reason slot -> drop the field.
- Dashboard worker/indexing error contains raw text -> map to `FILE_INDEX_DATABASE_BUSY` or a stable generic File Index code; dashboard transport failure returns `TUFF_DASHBOARD_FAILED`.

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: a real second SQLite connection holds `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`; packaged Electron returns the safe busy result, UI shows localized copy, local log correlates reportId to nested `SQLITE_BUSY`, and the same profile rebuilds after lock release.
- Base: a transient busy retry recovers; retry metrics/log summary update, no user failure and no detail-event storm occur.
- Bad: returning `error.message`, calling Sentry in every catch/retry, putting paths in `context`, calling writer APIs from inside the paused-admission callback, issuing main-process `UPDATE files`, or spreading a worker/dashboard payload across transport.

### 6. Tests Required

- Facade unit tests assert cause/code extraction, safe-message fallback, sensitive-context rejection, stable dedupe, bounded pre-init delivery, disabled detail delivery, and sync/async sink failure isolation.
- Retry tests assert direct and scheduler-wrapped exhaustion notify exactly once with attempts/code/rawCode/error.
- Writer/runtime tests assert pause -> drain -> local reset -> resume -> writer rebuild ordering, active/pending zero inside the barrier, and admission recovery on every throw/timeout path.
- Transport/UI tests assert `FILE_INDEX_DATABASE_BUSY` maps to localized copy and serialized results contain no SQL, `params:`, absolute path, or stack.
- Metadata repository tests assert duplicate/malformed batches execute no SQL, missing IDs do not resurrect rows, retry summaries do not double-count, and a real second connection lock fails then recovers.
- Public projector tests place canaries independently in every code/report/stage/status/reason/timestamp/name slot and assert serialized exact objects contain none.
- Dashboard tests assert POSIX/Windows paths become basenames, worker/task errors become stable codes, and Settings/LingPan source contracts contain no caught-Error logger or raw File Index fallback.
- App Provider tests assert add/update/delete/backfill/rebuild mutations use shared scheduler/retry and preserve file-row/extensions transaction behavior.
- Final evidence requires node/web typecheck, scoped lint, production build, and packaged Electron with an isolated profile plus a real second-connection `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`; mocks do not prove this contract.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
try {
  await resetIndex()
} catch (error) {
  Sentry.captureException(error)
  return {
    success: false,
    error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error),
  }
}
```

#### Correct

## Scenario: App Icon Self-Healing and Bounded LibSQL Write Phases

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing AppProvider startup/full-sync persistence, application icon cache identity, background icon hydration, or the initial App indexed-source scan.
- This contract prevents stale cache pointers from becoming permanent fallback icons and prevents scanner-sized local libSQL transaction counts from exhausting native database handles.

### 2. Signatures

```ts
resolveVersionedAppIconCachePath(
  appPath: string,
  bundleId: string,
  platform?: string,
): string | null;
resolveExistingVersionedAppIconCachePath(
  appPath: string,
  bundleId: string,
  platform?: string,
): string | null;
CoreDatabase["batch"];
```

The lifecycle invariant is `transaction count = O(write phases)`, never `O(scanned applications)`.

### 3. Contracts

- One shared cache utility owns platform cache versioning and the `bundleId || appPath` key. IconService, scanners, AppProvider repair, and recommendation mapping import it instead of duplicating hashes or version constants.
- Recommendation mapping checks a valid persisted path, then legacy filename migration, then the current identity cache. Mapping is local and bounded; it never invokes native extraction.
- Scanners only read caches. AppProvider hydrates misses outside SQLite work, persists one icon batch, and owns bounded delayed retries plus shutdown draining. Icon-only completion does not publish `IndexedSourceDelta`; any immediate refresh is metadata-only while `tfile` carries the resource bytes.
- Local `@libsql/client` interactive transactions detach a native connection; prepared statements can retain that connection until V8 collection after commit. AppProvider must not open one transaction per app and must not depend on `global.gc()` or an incomplete dependency patch.
- Metadata updates, icon-pointer repair, and hydrated-icon persistence use module-client `db.batch()`, whose statements execute atomically in one transaction. Additions use bounded phase transactions because extension rows require returned file IDs: each chunk is atomic, completed chunks remain committed if a later chunk fails, and the next idempotent scan fills the missing paths.
- Database-wide failure rejects the active phase and retries through the next scan. Scanner-level record failures are isolated before persistence; file rows and extension rows never commit partially within a chunk.
- SearchCore owns one initial App scan promise. It retries a failed scan at most three times with bounded backoff and stops immediately on shutdown abort.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Empty/stale persisted icon plus current identity cache -> return the cache-backed `tfile://` icon immediately and repair SQLite asynchronously.
- No persisted icon and no identity cache -> use the existing app fallback; background hydration may later publish an upsert.
- One statement in `db.batch()` fails -> libSQL rolls back the phase; shared SQLite retry handles transient busy errors.
- Hydration persistence exhausts retries -> retain the usable filesystem cache and log deferred persistence; a later scan can repair the pointer.
- Scanner rejects one malformed application -> omit/count that record without constructing a partial batch for it.
- Shutdown during hydration/backoff/initial scan -> abort or drain owned work; no orphan timer or parallel scan remains.
- Darwin native fallback -> `.icns -> sips` first, then the AppKit main-queue path writer. Reject unsupported `large`, native/worker image-byte payloads, and Electron/Chromium fallback; helper failure uses the normal class icon.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: 200 scanned apps produce a constant number of atomic write phases, stale pointers recover from deterministic caches on the first CoreBox query, and database handles remain bounded without forced GC.
- Base: no current cache exists; CoreBox keeps the normal fallback while asynchronous hydration attempts extraction and bounded persistence.
- Bad: one `db.transaction()` per application, renderer-side database repair, native extraction during result mapping, unbounded retries, or relabeling an unsigned local package as official release evidence.

### 6. Tests Required

- Cache tests assert deterministic versioned keys and existing-cache lookup for empty and stale persisted values.
- AppProvider tests assert add/update/icon operations preserve file-extension atomicity, addition transaction count scales with bounded chunks rather than individual applications, completed chunks survive a later chunk failure, and icon-only hydration produces zero search-index mutations.
- Native/protocol tests assert AppKit main-queue atomic path writing, descriptor-only completion, tfile allowlist enforcement, built-in file forwarding, and streaming response bodies without IPC/worker image bytes.
- Retry/lifecycle tests assert hydration stays usable during `SQLITE_BUSY`, persistence retries are bounded, initial scan is single-flight, and shutdown cancels backoff.
- Controlled libSQL evidence measures handle count before/after a high-cardinality AppProvider pass without `global.gc()`.
- Packaged Electron evidence uses an isolated profile before a real-profile smoke; it verifies real `tfile://` icons, repeated cold-start RSS/handle bounds, and absence of `EXC_BREAKPOINT`/`SIGTRAP`.
- Official native-trust completion requires an official-attested N+1 release; a local `signing-key-unavailable` package proves runtime behavior only.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
for (const app of scannedApps) {
  await db.transaction(async tx => persistApp(tx, app))
}
```

#### Correct

```ts
const statements = updates.flatMap(update => buildAppUpdateStatements(db, update))
await db.batch(statements as [AppDbBatchItem, ...AppDbBatchItem[]])
```

Use one addition transaction only when returned file IDs are required for atomic extension writes.

## Scenario: Durable Storage Save Before Lifecycle Admission

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing `StorageEvents.app.save`, `StorageSaveRequest`, immediate storage flush behavior, onboarding completion, or another renderer action that opens a main-process lifecycle gate.
- A cache update is not durable completion. The main process must acknowledge the gate only after the active storage backend has persisted the accepted value.

### 2. Signatures

```ts
interface StorageSaveRequest {
  key: string;
  value?: unknown;
  content?: string;
  clear?: boolean;
  force?: boolean;
  persist?: boolean;
  version?: number;
}

StorageEvents.app.save: TuffEvent<StorageSaveRequest, StorageSaveResponse>;
```

`persist: true` means the handler persists the accepted cache version before replying. Ordinary debounced saves keep `persist` omitted or `false`.

### 3. Contracts

- The renderer sends a detached, clone-safe snapshot. It must not mutate the reactive gate state before the durable request succeeds.
- Main applies normal conflict/version checks first. If the save is rejected, it does not flush or open the gate.
- With `persist: true`, main flushes the accepted version before returning success. Persistence failure returns `{ success: false }` with the current cache version and keeps the lifecycle gate closed; it must not reject, because a contended flush is an expected outcome and the caller needs a version to resync from.
- A durable flush absorbs transient SQLite `BUSY` with a bounded retry. A `persist: true` caller holds a lifecycle gate open and has no later debounce tick to fall back on, so it must not inherit the background write path's fail-fast-and-retry-next-tick policy.
- Persistence-internal cache reads use a non-touching accessor. Maintenance must not make a dirty entry look externally hot or hide a concurrent read from eviction checks.
- On persistence failure, main may restore the previous cache value only while the cache version still equals the failed request's accepted version. A newer concurrent write always wins and must never be overwritten by rollback.
- Onboarding marks `beginner.init` and closes the guide only after durable success. Shortcut completion asks the user whether to keep the primary window visible or hide it before summoning CoreBox; persistence failure leaves the guide and choice available with localized recovery feedback.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Missing/invalid key -> `{ success: false }`; no cache mutation or persistence.
- Version conflict -> conflict response; no durable flush.
- Accepted ordinary save -> update cache and use the existing debounce path.
- Accepted `persist: true` save -> flush the exact accepted version, then return success.
- Flush fails and no newer write exists -> restore the previous cache value and return `{ success: false }` with the restored version.
- Flush fails after a newer write -> return `{ success: false }` without rollback; preserve the newer version.
- Renderer request rejects or returns unsuccessful -> keep onboarding visible and keep the main-process admission gate closed.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: onboarding sends a detached completed settings snapshot with `persist: true`; main persists it, replies, and only then the renderer closes the guide and summons CoreBox.
- Base: a normal setting edit updates cache and uses debounced persistence without blocking the UI.
- Bad: mutate `appSetting.beginner.init` first and race its debounce against an immediate save, treat cache acceptance as durable success, or roll back over a newer concurrent write.

### 6. Tests Required

- Storage handler tests assert ordinary save behavior, durable success ordering, persistence failure rollback, and newer-write preservation.
- Renderer tests assert the reactive beginner state and window lifecycle stay unchanged while persistence is pending and after failure.
- Onboarding flow tests assert success order: durable save -> beginner state -> guide close, then either keep the primary window visible with no CoreBox summon or hide the primary window -> summon CoreBox.
- Run focused storage/onboarding tests, CoreApp node/web type-checks, and `git diff --check`. An isolated Electron profile is still required before claiming the complete window-lifecycle experience.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
appSetting.beginner.init = true
await transport.send(StorageEvents.app.save, {
  key: StorageList.APP_SETTING,
  value: appSetting,
})
closeGuide()
```

#### Correct

```ts
const result = await transport.send(StorageEvents.app.save, {
  key: StorageList.APP_SETTING,
  value: structuredClone(completedSettings),
  persist: true,
})
if (!result.success) return keepGuideOpen()
appSetting.beginner.init = true
closeGuide()
```
