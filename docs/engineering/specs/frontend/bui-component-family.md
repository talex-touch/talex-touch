# BUI Component Family (Beautiful UI port)

> Conventions for the 26 tuffex component directories adapted from Beautiful UI (beautifului.dev, MIT, © 2026 Shane Levine): 24 landed 2026-08-15 via the archived task record [`08-15-beautiful-ui-port`](https://github.com/talex-touch/tuff/tree/0ca5b37b8c4a8e177b6dc0ac06f30e51c5ea748e/.trellis/tasks/archive/2026-08/08-15-beautiful-ui-port), `agent-screen` and `flowchart` on 2026-09-21 via `09-21-bui-parity-and-interaction`. These rules bind any future work on `tx-bui-*` components and any new pixel-matched family.

---

## Token layer

- `packages/tuffex/packages/components/style/bui-tokens.scss` defines `--tx-bui-*` (33 colour/shadow tokens × light/dark + radius-chip/control/card + `--tx-bui-font-mono`). Values are upstream originals **on purpose** — they deliberately do NOT resolve to the `--tx-*` semantic ramp (nearest-neighbour ΔRGB reaches 96 in dark). Hosts wanting brand colours override the variables in their own scope.
- Dark selector is the shared `[data-theme='dark'], .dark` pair — same switch as `variables.scss`, zero adaptation.
- `--shadow-overlay` swaps its ring from `line` to `line-strong` in dark: the one structural (not numeric) light/dark difference. Do not generate both themes from one template.
- High-contrast themes intentionally do NOT remap `--tx-bui-*` (documented limitation in the ai-suite doc).
- BUI visual language uses **ring shadows instead of borders** (`0 0 0 1px` spread). Never both — double-line trap. Never `@include elevation()` for these components.

## Mixins & keyframes

- `style/mixins.scss` carries `bui-scope` (local reset + 13px base — BUI layouts assume Tailwind preflight, tuffex ships no global reset), 10 `bui-keyframes-*` mixins (`tx-bui-*` names), and surface mixins (`bui-shimmer-text`, `bui-fade-up`, `bui-pop-in`, `bui-spring-in`, `bui-disclosure-collapse`, `bui-tabular-nums`, `bui-card-bar/pad`, `bui-press-scale`).
- Keyframes are emitted **per component via mixin**, never in the global stylesheet — subpath consumers only get their component's CSS (same rationale as `skeleton-keyframes`, documented at `mixins.scss`).
- `--tx-ease-out-strong: cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)` in `variables.scss` is the family's master easing.
- `--tx-ease-spring: cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)` is the overshoot curve. `bui-pop-in` is ease-out and can never pass its end value; an entrance that should read as springy uses `bui-spring-in` (`scale(0.88) translateY(8px)` on `--tx-ease-spring`, 340ms) — TxSelectionActions does. Do not retune `bui-pop-in` itself to get that: nine components share it.

## Hard rules for tx-bui components

1. **Pure controlled primitives.** Demo timelines (stage machines, tick arrays, reveal cadences) live in nexus demo SFCs, not components. Exceptions require the machine to BE the component's semantic (TxDiffTable's play stages, TxWorkingIndicator's timer).
2. **Reduced motion per component**: cut tweens, keep state machines, zero delays too, and never rely on a base `opacity: 0` that only an animation reveals — resting styles must be visible. JS/WAAPI motion needs a `matchMedia` guard; CSS `animation: none` handles the rest. Verify with a compiled-SCSS contract test (`sass.compileString` + assertions; see `context-cards-motion.test.ts`, `fine-tune-card-motion.test.ts`).
3. Class prefix `tx-bui-<component>__element`; never attach `.tx-card` / `.tx-base-surface` / `.fake-background` (the `data-tx-coloring` layer adds a second ring).
4. `<style lang="scss">` non-scoped; every `var()` carries an inline fallback; `color-mix(in oklab, …)` when reproducing BUI translucency; no `@supports` fallback layers.
5. Half-pixel font sizes (13/12.5/11.5/10.5px) are the density language — keep them. Numbers use `tabular-nums`; signed figures use U+2212 `−`.
6. Links never self-navigate — `href` renders for affordance, `preventDefault` + `@open` emit (TxSources convention, Electron rule).
7. a11y is ported to tuffex standard, not upstream's: combobox pattern for token menus, listbox keyboard nav for search, `aria-checked="mixed"` for tri-state, `inert` + `aria-hidden` on collapsed content. Bind inert as `:inert="open ? undefined : true"` — Vue renders `:inert="false"` as `inert="false"`, which is still inert.
8. MIT header in every component SFC: `Adapted from Beautiful UI (https://www.beautifului.dev), © 2026 Shane Levine, MIT.`

## Registration chain for a new tuffex component (6 stops, all audited or load-bearing)

1. `packages/components/src/components.ts` — full-path ASCII order (`-` sorts before `/`: `card-item` < `card/`).
2. `README.md` + `README_ZHCN.md` — total count line + category line (entries per line must equal the parenthesised count; `audit:readme` gates CI).
3. Nothing to register by hand in nexus. `apps/nexus/modules/tuffex-components.ts` reads every component directory's barrel (`src/<dir>/index.ts`, following one `export *` hop, skipping the `ai`/`base`/`pro`/`utils` aggregates) and `addComponent`s each `Tx*`/`Tuff*` export, so a component is global the moment its barrel exports it. It replaced a hand-maintained `app/plugins/tuffex.ts` list that had drifted by sixteen components. Two barrels exporting one name throw at config time. **Composables are never registered** (useTokenMenu, useSelectionAnchor, useIndicatorBox, useElapsed — plain imports); a component missing from its own barrel is not either, and an mdc demo using it fails only at render time.
4. `apps/nexus/app/components/content/demo-registry.ts` — alphabetical. CI-gated since 2026-08-27: `check:demo-registry` fails on registry↔file↔content divergence (a helper .vue imported by another demo is exempt; anything else unreferenced is an orphan).
5. Doc pair `content/docs/dev/components/<kebab>.{zh,en}.mdc` — 8-field frontmatter, `since: 2.5.0`+ for new adds, 中文段名, Title Case English headings, zh/en equal section counts, linked from both hubs. CI-gated since 2026-08-27: `check:doc-parity` fails on zh/en heading-shape divergence; the per-doc contract (`## API`, Props heading, exactly `Best Practices`/`最佳实践`, hub links) is enforced only by the nexus test suite — see component-guidelines › TuffEx Suite Taxonomy.
6. `pnpm -C packages/tuffex build` before any downstream typecheck (exports resolve to `dist/`), then `pnpm -C apps/nexus typecheck` (wrapper, not `:raw`) and `pnpm -C apps/nexus exec vitest run` — CI blocks on the latter, and the gate scripts do not cover what it checks. Also run core-app's `vue-tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.web.json --composite false` (its `typecheck:web`, part of CI's `typecheck:all`): core-app compiles tuffex **source** under `noUnusedLocals`, which tuffex's own vue-tsc does not enable, so a local that only a template string ref names (`ref="canvasEl"`) passes in tuffex and fails there with TS6133. Finally run the tuffex publish chain on that fresh build — `audit:exports`, `audit:readme`, `audit:types`, `audit:size` (the publish workflow runs it on every master push touching `packages/tuffex`). A new component's stylesheet usually pushes `audit:size` over: re-baseline `LIMITS`, and any `pageStyleBudgets` page whose closure the sheet joins, in `scripts/audit-package-size.mjs` to actuals plus minimal headroom with a dated note. Inlining another component's rules needs no manual check any more: the same audit fails on any rule repeated verbatim across two sheets.

## Traps confirmed during this port

- **Vue casts an absent boolean prop to `false`, not `undefined`** — any `props.x ?? internal` dual-mode boolean needs an explicit `x: undefined` in `withDefaults`, or the fallback is dead.
- Suites mounting components with document-level listeners need `enableAutoUnmount(afterEach)` — a mounted leftover consumes events and corrupts the *next* test.
- jsdom: no `isContentEditable` (pair the property check with a `closest('[contenteditable]')` walk), no `PointerEvent` constructor, `getContext('2d')` returns null (keep canvas painting in a separate testable module).
- eslint must run per-package (`pnpm -C packages/tuffex exec eslint`, same for nexus) — the root config cannot parse either package's SFCs.
- A component whose popup anchors a **virtual reference** while its trigger is a sibling element (TxContextMenu's shape) must own outside-close itself and pass `close-on-click-outside: false` to the anchor — the anchor cannot tell the trigger from "outside". The anchor's 60ms post-open grace window masks this class in fast single-file test runs and unmasks it under a slow full suite: never rely on real wall-clock inside open/close logic tests; controlled mounts (`modelValue: true`) start with the window already expired.
- `TxScroll`'s default (BetterScroll transform) kills `position: sticky` descendants — sticky tables need native `overflow: auto`.
- **A raw control byte makes git treat a source file as binary.** TxFlowchart's id separator was committed as a literal NUL byte inside `join('…')`: the whole SFC then diffs as `Binary files differ` (unreviewable in a PR) and grep-based audits skip it — the MIT-header count came out one short. Write the escape (`'\u0000'`, same runtime string), and before committing source check `git diff --cached --numstat` for rows whose added/removed counts are `-` — git's mark for a file it considers binary.
