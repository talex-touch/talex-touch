# Channel / Transport Contracts (main ↔ renderer)

## Scenario: main process notifies a renderer (intent/notification events)

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Any main→renderer send of a TuffEvent. The channel layer has two distinct delivery
modes and picking the wrong one produces 60s timeout warnings that `.catch()` cannot
suppress (2026-08-06, `core-box:ui:shortcut-triggered`).

### 2. Signatures

```ts
// Request-response: registers a pending entry + CHANNEL_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT (60s) timer
// (channel-core.ts:23); on expiry channel-core.ts:727 logs
// `[Channel] Request "<name>" timed out after 60000ms` — the caller's .catch() only
// swallows the promise rejection, never this WARN.
transport.sendTo(webContents, event, payload): Promise<TRes>
transport.sendToWindow(windowId, event, payload): Promise<TRes>

// Fire-and-forget: same envelope minus the sync block; no pending entry, no timer.
transport.broadcastToWindow(windowId, event, payload): void

// Fire-and-forget to the exact captured WebContents; optional host-issued plugin owner snapshot.
// Returns false for a destroyed, foreign, unregistered or stale plugin recipient.
transport.notifyTo(webContents, event, payload, plugin?): boolean
```

### 3. Contracts

- **Notification events (`define<void, void>()` / no consumer of the response) MUST use
  `broadcastToWindow` or owner-directed `notifyTo`.** `sendTo`/`sendToWindow` are only for calls that read the reply.
- Delivery target is identical either way: `broadcastToWindow` resolves
  `BrowserWindow.fromId(id).webContents` — the same object `sendTo(webContents, …)` took.
- Renderer side needs no changes when switching: `__handle_main` dispatches non-reply
  envelopes purely by event name to the same `transport.on(event, …)` listener.
- Port channel is not a fork: only the allowlist in `transport/sdk/port-policy.ts`
  (clipboard change, file-index progress, search indexCommitted by default) rides
  MessagePorts; everything else uses the bridge in both modes. Short-lived
  `core-box:search:session` streams default to typed channel transport so a new
  query never waits for an optional Port upgrade. Explicit environment allowlists
  remain supported; do not add the search session back to the default set merely
  because its output is streamed.
- Session-owned output uses `notifyTo` with the concrete sender captured from the trusted
  `HandlerContext`. It never selects the recipient by a numeric sender/window id or plugin name.
  For plugin output the transport binds the host-issued identity to that exact sender before
  dispatch, then rechecks the activation key, instance, generation and registered recipient at
  delivery. Revocation, rotation or a foreign object with the same numeric id drops the output;
  it never sends old output to a replacement activation. The channel uses the PLUGIN envelope
  and its existing per-surface key masking, without a sync block or an RPC acknowledgement.
- `terminal:session:data` and `terminal:session:exit` use that directed path. The SDK registers
  both subscriptions before creating the PTY, preserves early events in FIFO order, and releases
  subscriptions on exit, close, failure or cancellation. Renderer loss, navigation and module
  disposal also terminate the main-owned PTY; reloading a renderer is not proof of sender destruction.
- Cancellation does not depend on receiving a creation id. The SDK injects a private creation
  token; main reserves the concrete trusted owner before asynchronous checks, then only spawns
  after permission and business gates pass. The existing close/kill event accepts that token to
  abort a pending reservation or close its associated PTY. Abort and create-send failure both
  request cleanup, including a lost creation reply; a token is never an ownership credential.
  Expected cancellation becomes `AbortError` only after cleanup succeeds. Failed close/kill
  instead rejects `AggregateError` containing the original failure and cleanup error, with the
  cleanup error as `cause`; callers must not treat that as successful or ordinary cancellation.
- PTY close is an actual native-exit barrier. Closing prevents new write/resize, requests kill
  once, retains the exit listener and native-session lease, then releases them after `onExit`.
  Module destruction and typed close/kill await that barrier. Signal termination must not turn
  a native `exitCode: 0` plus a positive signal into successful command completion.
- Single-path delivery per envelope: main's stream runtime sends each chunk/end/error
  over the port when it still holds a confirmed record, otherwise over the bridge
  (`server-runtime.ts sendWithFallback`) — never both. The client runtime therefore
  delivers whatever arrives on either path; it must not treat a bridge envelope as a
  duplicate because the port was active earlier. That guard (`portActive` in the bridge
  handlers) made a long-lived CoreBox deaf to `index-committed` once main dropped its
  port record (2026-09-21). If double delivery is ever introduced, dedupe by
  streamId + sequence in the protocol, do not restore the guard. Anchors:
  `renderer-transport-stream.test.ts` "delivers channel chunks and the channel end
  after the port has already been active".
- `broadcastToWindow` throws synchronously if the window id is gone (`sendTo` rejected
  instead) — validate the window (`isDestroyed()`) before sending, as `show()` does.
- A broadcast to a still-loading webContents is dropped, same as an unanswered `sendTo`
  minus the hang. If delivery must be guaranteed, queue on the renderer-ready signal —
  do not "fix" it by switching back to request-response.
- A short-lived `WebContentsView` that cannot use `broadcastToWindow` must pair request-style
  `sendTo` with a real response and an explicit renderer-ready handshake. Document load,
  `isLoading() === false`, `dom-ready`, and `did-finish-load` do not prove that the route component
  registered its transport listeners.
- Derive the ready sender from `HandlerContext`; never trust a renderer-authored id. Accept only
  the current owned WebContents, keep at most the latest pending payload, keep the view hidden until
  readiness, and clear pending/ready state on hide, destruction, or renderer loss.
- `MetaOverlayEvents.ui.show` is the concrete bidirectional example: CoreBox → main and main → the
  MetaOverlay renderer each return `{ accepted: true }`; `MetaOverlayEvents.ui.ready` releases the
  current manager's pending show exactly once.
- Renderer transport payloads must remain structured-cloneable. Storing an incoming IPC object in a
  deep Vue `ref` turns it into a Proxy that Electron cannot clone on the return trip; use
  `shallowRef` (or an explicitly reconstructed plain DTO) for opaque transport records and defend
  the outbound payload with a real `structuredClone` regression.
  - The quieter variant: anything read off a reactive collection is already a Proxy, before any
    `ref` is involved. CoreBox's Flow dispatch built its payload from the focused TuffItem in the
    reactive results and kept it in a deep `ref`, so every `flow:bus:dispatch` failed with
    `An object could not be cloned` (2026-10-02; silent, because CoreBox mounts no toast host).
    Build such payloads from `toRaw(item)` and hold them in a `shallowRef`
    (`useDetach.openFlowSelector`); `useDetach.test.ts` dispatches a `reactive()` item and asserts the
    sent payload survives `structuredClone` with no Proxy along the item path.

### 4. Validation & error matrix

| Condition                                                | Outcome                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `sendTo` a void event, renderer listener not yet mounted | silent 60s hang → WARN in channel-core, per send |
| `broadcastToWindow` with destroyed window id             | synchronous throw at call site                   |
| Broadcast before renderer registers listener             | event dropped (pre-existing semantics)           |

### 5. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
void transport.sendTo(window.window.webContents, CoreBoxEvents.ui.shortcutTriggered, undefined).catch(() => {}) // swallows the rejection, NOT the channel-core timeout WARN
```

#### Correct

```ts
this.getTransport().broadcastToWindow(window.window.id, CoreBoxEvents.ui.shortcutTriggered, undefined)
```

### 6. Tests required

Mock the transport as a **stable object** (a factory returning a fresh object per call
makes call-order assertions silently vacuous — `window.test.ts` had this trap). Assert:
broadcast called with (windowId, event, payload), `sendTo` never called, and relative
ordering against sibling events (`window.test.ts` "broadcasts the shortcut intent…" is the model).

Owner-directed notification regressions also cover a foreign WebContents object with the same
numeric id, plugin activation rotation/revocation, and two plugin windows under the same name.
Assert only the original concrete recipient gets the complete data and that no RPC pending entry
or shared UIView broadcast is created (`packages/utils/__tests__/main-transport-identity.test.ts`).

Terminal lifecycle regressions cover lost create acknowledgements, cancellation during permission
or Provider/executable lookup, cross-owner token cancellation, full/early output and real-exit
barriers. A kill request alone is not evidence of process cleanup or lease release.

### 7. Known remaining instance

`core-box/index.ts:94` sends `CoreBoxEvents.beginner.shortcutTriggered` via
`sendToWindow` to the main window; its only listener lives in onboarding `Done.vue`.
Gated by `admission.state === 'blocked'`, so it only warns for users mid-onboarding.
Convert to broadcast on next touch of that file.

## Scenario: Register Main Stream Handlers Before Creating Their Renderer

- A renderer may start a typed stream as soon as its component mounts. Clipboard monitoring
  consumers use `clipboardTransport.onClipboardChange()` to start `ClipboardEvents.change`.
- The owning main module must therefore register the base event's `onStream` handler before the
  module that creates/prewarms that renderer. `app-ready`, `dom-ready`, and `did-finish-load` do
  not prove handler readiness.
- The foreground startup order keeps `clipboardModule` before `coreBoxModule`; a contract test
  must compare their actual positions. Reversing them produces
  `clipboard:monitor:change:stream:start` / `reason=no_handler` during a fresh process.
- Do not hide the race with renderer retries or a swallowed `.catch()`: those suppress UI fallout,
  not the missing-handler request or its performance/error records.

## Scenario: Renderer Quiesce Before Main Handler Teardown

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Changing app quit order, renderer transport destruction, auto-save, or renderer performance reporting. Main modules unregister request handlers during `BEFORE_APP_QUIT`; a still-sending renderer otherwise produces `No handler registered` storms.

### 2. Signatures

```ts
quiesceRenderersBeforeQuit(): Promise<void>
TuffRendererTransport.destroy(): void
reportPerfToMain(report: RendererPerfReport): void
```

### 3. Contracts

- Before emitting `TalexEvents.BEFORE_APP_QUIT`, main sends `AppEvents.lifecycle.beforeQuit` to every live app renderer (excluding DevTools) and waits up to 1.5 seconds for acknowledgements.
- The renderer flushes pending transport batches, then destroys its transport. `destroy()` is idempotent and permanently rejects every later `send()` before the underlying channel.
- The finalizer fallback broadcast is idempotent; it must not reopen renderer work after quiesce.
- Performance reporting never reports the `app:analytics:perf-report` event itself. A missing perf handler must not recursively generate another perf report.
- Default-session permissions remain denied during shutdown, but expected denial logs are suppressed once `TouchApp.isQuitting` is true.
- Search shutdown closes admission and initiates scan cancellation/producer stop before awaiting session or watcher-queue drains. A watcher waiting for the scan's mutation gate must not prevent that scan from receiving its cancellation. Every concurrently started drain needs an immediate rejection handler; the writer closes only after successful drains.
- The completed `before-quit` latch is set before final broadcast or delegation to `DevProcessManager`: its synchronous `app.quit()` re-enters `before-quit` and must be allowed through, not prevented behind the still-pending first promise.
- Sentry stops accepting telemetry and detaches producer subscriptions/timers at the start of `onDestroy`. Already accepted events still flush while Storage/Database are live. Late lifecycle events and captured polling callbacks cannot re-arm work after destroy; re-init restores admission. Do not mask a dependency-order defect with an endpoint fallback or claim an in-memory batch survives process exit.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition                                    | Required outcome                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Renderer acknowledges                        | Flush/destroy completes before storage/analytics handlers unload |
| Renderer hangs or already died               | 1.5s bound expires; main continues shutdown                      |
| Debounced save fires after destroy           | Reject locally with transport-destroyed error; no main IPC       |
| Perf-report send itself fails                | No recursive performance report                                  |
| Permission request arrives after quit begins | Deny silently; no shutdown-noise warning                         |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: benchmark/user quit logs `App quit requested` with zero post-request `storage:app:save` or `app:analytics:perf-report` missing-handler pairs.
- Base: one renderer flushes immediately and normal module unload proceeds.
- Bad: unload main handlers first, then broadcast shutdown; or make `destroy()` remove listeners while leaving `send()` live.

### 6. Tests Required

- Renderer transport test: after `destroy()`, `send()` rejects and the fake channel receives zero calls.
- Existing before-quit guard/finalizer/module-manager tests stay green.
- Isolated Electron auto-quit smoke: inspect the post-`App quit requested` log for missing-handler recursion and permission-denial noise.
- Quit during an active scan: verify scan cancellation, writer-last cleanup, `exit 0`, and no outer quit timeout, DevProcessManager forced exit, or post-Storage telemetry rejection. A `blocking` perf-context enclosing `await` is a wall-clock span, not proof of continuous synchronous execution.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

```ts
// Wrong: request producers stay alive after main handlers disappear.
await unloadAll('app-quit')
transport.broadcast(AppEvents.lifecycle.beforeQuit, undefined)

// Correct: quiesce renderers, then unload handlers; destroyed transports reject locally.
await quiesceRenderersBeforeQuit()
await touchEventBus.emitAsync(TalexEvents.BEFORE_APP_QUIT, quitEvent)
```

## Scenario: Owner-Bound Stream And MessagePort Lifecycle

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: registering a main-process stream handler, accepting a stream start or
  cancel envelope, upgrading a MessagePort, rotating plugin activation authority,
  destroying a sender, or unregistering the handler.
- This contract spans the raw MAIN/PLUGIN lanes, authoritative plugin identity,
  server stream runtime, MessagePort registry, and Electron `WebContents` lifecycle.

### 2. Signatures

```ts
type ServerStreamOwnerKey = object

interface ServerStreamRequest<TReq, TSender, TPlugin = unknown> {
  streamId: string
  ownerKey: ServerStreamOwnerKey
  portId?: string
  payload: TReq
  sender: TSender
  plugin?: TPlugin
}

interface ServerStreamCancelRequest {
  streamId?: string | null
  ownerKey: ServerStreamOwnerKey
}

interface ServerStreamRuntime<TReq, TSender, TPlugin = unknown> {
  handleStart(request: ServerStreamRequest<TReq, TSender, TPlugin>): void
  handleCancel(request: ServerStreamCancelRequest): void
  cancelOwner(ownerKey: ServerStreamOwnerKey): void
  cancelAll(): void
  dispose(): void
}
```

`ownerKey` is a host-only opaque object. It is never accepted from a renderer or
plugin payload.

### 3. Contracts

- Resolve ownership from the concrete sender object plus the host-selected lane.
  Each sender has separate MAIN and unverified-PLUGIN owners. Each authoritative
  plugin activation has another owner keyed by its current host-issued activation
  key; actor name alone is insufficient.
- The same `streamId` may exist for different owners. A second active id for the
  same owner throws `stream_id_conflict` and leaves the original stream active.
- Cancel resolves the owner again from the real sender, lane, and current branded
  identity. Ignore caller-authored owner fields. A foreign sender, lane, activation,
  or unverified caller cannot cancel another owner's stream.
- Terminal `end`/`error`, explicit cancel, activation invalidation, sender destroy,
  and handler unregister all remove forward and reverse indexes exactly once.
  Cancel aborts the owned `AbortSignal`; late `emit`/`end`/`error` callbacks are
  silent and cannot recreate state or send data.
- Sender destruction cancels all MAIN, unverified-PLUGIN, and authoritative plugin
  owners for that exact `WebContents`. Handler unregister removes channel handlers,
  invalidation watchers, and sender listeners before disposing all active state.
- A plugin MessagePort is confirmed, resolved, used, and closed only when the
  concrete sender object, channel, scope, port id, and complete authoritative
  activation provenance match. A numeric sender id is not ownership.
- Plugin activation invalidation physically closes ports with the exact activation
  key, clears pending confirm timers, and removes both global and sender indexes.
  MAIN/window ports and other plugin activations remain open.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition                                    | Required result                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Duplicate active id under one owner          | `stream_id_conflict`; original remains active                    |
| Same id under another sender/lane/activation | Independent stream accepted                                      |
| Foreign sender/lane/activation cancel        | No effect on target stream                                       |
| Current owner cancel                         | Exact signal aborts; later callbacks are silent                  |
| Activation rotates or revokes                | Exact plugin streams abort and ports close                       |
| Sender is destroyed                          | All streams/ports for that object close; foreign object survives |
| Handler unregisters                          | Handlers/watchers/listeners removed; all active streams abort    |
| Same numeric sender id, different object     | No port confirmation, lookup, use, or close                      |
| Port terminal send fails                     | Fallback may run; stream state still cleans up                   |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: two senders reuse one stream id; cancelling one aborts only its signal, and
  rotating one plugin activation closes only its streams and MessagePorts.
- Base: a current owner reaches `end`; its state is removed and the same id can be
  reused by that owner later.
- Bad: index streams globally by id, trust `ownerKey` from the payload, compare only
  `sender.id`, or leave watchers/ports alive after revoke or handler unregister.

### 6. Tests Required

- Runtime tests cover same-owner duplicate rejection, cross-owner id reuse, exact
  cancel, cancel-all/dispose, terminal cleanup, send failure, and late callbacks.
- Transport tests cover MAIN vs raw PLUGIN lanes, verified vs unverified plugin
  owners, activation rotation/revoke, sender destruction, and unregister cleanup.
- MessagePort tests use two sender objects with the same numeric id and cover
  confirm/use/close isolation, complete activation provenance, physical close on
  invalidation, confirm-timer cleanup, and no collateral close.
- Every regression asserts both the target was cleaned up and an unrelated stream
  or port stayed live; a one-sided cleanup assertion is insufficient.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
const activeStreams = new Map<string, StreamState>()
activeStreams.get(payload.streamId)?.abortController.abort()
if (record.sender.id === event.sender.id) record.confirmed = true
```

#### Correct

```ts
const ownerKey = resolveOwnerKey(channelType, event.sender, authoritativePlugin, true)
runtime.handleStart({ streamId, ownerKey, payload, sender: event.sender, plugin })

const cancelOwnerKey = resolveOwnerKey(channelType, event.sender, authoritativePlugin, false)
if (cancelOwnerKey) runtime.handleCancel({ streamId, ownerKey: cancelOwnerKey })
if (record.sender === event.sender) record.confirmed = true
```

## Scenario: Typed Reasoning Effort On Intelligence Requests

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing `IntelligenceInvokeOptions.reasoningEffort`, the decision it resolves to on
  events and results, the shared table `packages/utils/intelligence/reasoning-effort.ts`, or any
  hop that carries them: renderer → `intelligence:api:stream` / `intelligence:api:invoke` → main
  SDK → provider → Tuff Nexus `/api/v1/intelligence/{stream,invoke}` → upstream adapter.
- The field rides the existing events; no channel is added.

### 2. Signatures

```ts
IntelligenceInvokeOptions.reasoningEffort?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'max' // absent = auto

interface IntelligenceReasoningEffortDecision {
  requested: IntelligenceReasoningEffort
  applied: IntelligenceReasoningLevel | null // null whenever nothing was sent
  status: 'applied' | 'clamped' | 'unsupported-model' | 'unsupported-provider' | 'forwarded'
}
IntelligenceStreamEvent.reasoningEffort?  // `start` and `end` only
IntelligenceInvokeResult.reasoningEffort?
IntelligenceStreamChunk.reasoningEffort?  // a routed backend's own report (Nexus)

sanitizeReasoningRequest(options)                       // main SDK entry
planProviderReasoning(options, providerConfig, model)   // one plan per provider attempt
settleReasoningDecision(plan, reported)                 // what `end` / the result carries
```

### 3. Contracts

- Auto is absence. The renderer omits the field (`normalizeReasoningEffort` maps `auto` and anything
  unknown to `undefined`); without it main plans nothing, and every request body and CLI argv is
  byte-identical to the pre-setting one.
- Every hop re-normalizes and drops rather than forwards: the renderer's settings read and request,
  the main SDK entry (`sanitizeReasoningRequest` in `prepareRuntimeOptions` and `invokeStream`,
  before routing and the cache key), Nexus `parseRequest` / `invokeIntelligenceCapability`, and
  every decision read off the wire or out of stored turn meta (`normalizeReasoningEffortDecision`).
- The plan is host-only. The SDK entry strips a caller's `reasoningPlan`; the SDK attaches main's
  plan per provider attempt, for `chat` capabilities only, after the provider is chosen and its
  model preference applied. Providers translate `readReasoningPlan(options)` and never re-decide.
  Nexus plans per upstream context with the same table.
- The planned model is the surviving preference or the provider's `defaultModel`; a missing one is
  sent nothing (`unsupported-model`). One exception: the Codex CLI handed no model runs the `model`
  in its own `~/.codex/config.toml`, so the plan reads it (`readCodexConfiguredModel()`) instead of
  refusing a route that answers every unpinned turn.
- `end` (or the invoke result) is authoritative: a fallback provider's `start` is swallowed, and a
  routed backend may report mid-stream. The renderer records `start`, then lets the final decision
  replace it whole, as flat structured-cloneable turn-meta fields.
- A routed backend's report replaces only main's `forwarded` placeholder, and only when it answers
  the same `requested` level; main's own decisions are never overruled.
- Audit metadata carries exactly `reasoningEffort` / `reasoningApplied` / `reasoningStatus`, always
  set from main's decision, so caller metadata cannot claim a level main never resolved.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Result |
|---|---|
| Composer on auto, or no getter | field omitted; no plan; no decision on any event, result or audit |
| Unknown level (`'ultra'`, `'xhigh'`, a number) at any hop | dropped at that hop; never forwarded or planned |
| Caller-supplied `reasoningPlan` | stripped at the SDK entry |
| Non-chat capability carrying a level | planned nothing; no decision on the result |
| Route or model takes no effort | `unsupported-provider` / `unsupported-model`, `applied: null`; request built exactly as on auto |
| Model lacks the level | nearest level, stronger first → `clamped`; `max` = the model's strongest → `applied` |
| Nexus route on a server without the field | `forwarded` stays |
| Nexus report that contradicts itself or names another `requested` | ignored; `forwarded` stays |
| Provider fails before the first delta | the fallback is re-planned for itself; `end` carries its decision |

### 5. Tests Required

- Shared table and plans: `packages/utils/__tests__/reasoning-effort.test.ts`.
- Main: `reasoning-effort-runtime.test.ts`, `intelligence-sdk.reasoning.test.ts` (auto plans
  nothing and puts no decision on events; per-attempt re-plan; forged plan stripped; audit keys).
- Wire: the provider `*.reasoning.test.ts` suites pin the **whole** auto body or argv as literals,
  not only the absence of the new field, and assert a plan that sends nothing builds the auto bytes.
- Renderer: `useHomeConversation.reasoning.test.ts` (exact auto request shape, same level on the
  non-streaming fallback, clone-safe turn meta), `turn-info-rows.test.ts`, `HomeModelMenu.test.ts`.
- Nexus: `tuffIntelligenceReasoningEffort.test.ts`, `tuffIntelligenceLangChainProviderAdapters.test.ts`,
  `test/api/v1/intelligence/stream.post.test.ts`.

## Scenario: A Transport Deadline Must Cover Every Main-Side Budget It Spans

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Any `transport.send` whose main-side handler spends more than one budget: waiting on the user, a
size-dependent transfer, or a long post-processing step. Getting the wall shorter than the sum of
those budgets reports a failure for work that is still running.

### 2. Signatures

```ts
// packages/utils/plugin/install-budgets.ts
export function resolvePackageDownloadTimeout(packageSize?: number): number
export const INSTALL_CONFIRM_BUDGET_MS: number
export const INSTALL_UNPACK_BUDGET_MS: number
export const INSTALL_TRANSPORT_TIMEOUT_MS: number
```

### 3. Contracts

- `plugin:install-source` and `plugin:api:install` both route into the same main-side install queue
  and span three budgets: the package download (sized from the registry's advertised `packageSize`),
  the permission/confirmation prompt (bounded only by the renderer card's auto-deny), and unpack +
  signature verification + registration.
- Both transport deadlines are the sum of the worst case of each — `INSTALL_TRANSPORT_TIMEOUT_MS` —
  so they can only fire when the main process stopped answering. Every stage inside enforces its own
  tighter deadline; the outer wall is a backstop, never the liveness control. `plugin:api:install`
  used the 60s transport default, which is *shorter* than the permission card's own 120s budget: a
  user who answered after a minute got a failure report for an install that was still running.
- The budgets live in one shared module. The renderer's `PERMISSION_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` is that
  module's `INSTALL_CONFIRM_BUDGET_MS`: raising the card's auto-deny without raising the wall
  reintroduces the false failure below.
- A fixed 3-minute wall here is wrong by construction — verified 2026-09-26: the 14 MB JSON
  Formatter download succeeded in 59s, the permission card went unanswered, and at 180s the store
  reported `安装失败 ... Channel request "plugin:install-source" timed out after 180000ms` while the
  main process was still holding the prepared install.
- Residual gap (not fixed, needs a product decision): the *plain* confirmation dialog
  (`install-manager.handleConfirm`, non-permission branch) waits for the user with no budget of its
  own, so only the 780 s wall bounds it. Bounding it needs the mention dialog to auto-dismiss,
  which is a UX decision rather than a contract fix.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required outcome |
|---|---|
| User answers the permission card within the budget | install proceeds; the wall is never reached |
| User ignores the permission card | the card auto-denies at `INSTALL_CONFIRM_BUDGET_MS`; the install fails with the rejection reason, not a transport timeout |
| Advertised `packageSize` unknown | download keeps the 30s floor; the transport wall still uses the ceiling-based budget |
| Package larger than the ceiling can cover | download dies with `NETWORK_TIMEOUT` at the ceiling; the wall still outlasts it |
| Main process stops answering entirely | the wall fires `channel.send.timeout` — the only case where it should |

### 5. Tests Required

- `packages/utils/__tests__/install-budgets.test.ts`: the wall covers download ceiling + confirm +
  unpack for every sampled size, and is strictly larger than the old flat 3 minutes.
- `packages/utils/__tests__/plugin-install-deadline.test.ts`: `installFromSource` and `install`
  send with the derived budget.
- Renderer guard: `PERMISSION_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS <= INSTALL_CONFIRM_BUDGET_MS`.

### 6. Wrong vs Correct

```ts
// Wrong: a flat wall shorter than the budgets the call spans.
transport.send(PluginEvents.install.source, payload, { timeout: 3 * 60 * 1000 })

// Correct: the wall is the sum of the worst case of every budget inside the call.
transport.send(PluginEvents.install.source, payload, { timeout: INSTALL_TRANSPORT_TIMEOUT_MS })
```
