# Search Hot-Path Contracts (main process)

Source: task 08-05-search-hotpath-quadratic-fix (2026-08-05). These are executable
contracts for the per-keystroke CoreBox search path; violating them reintroduces the
quadratic-per-keystroke bug class this task removed.

## Scenario: code on the per-keystroke search path

CoreBox query → provider `onSearch` → candidate scoring → result build. Budget
context: `SLOW_PROCESS_THRESHOLD_MS = 300` (search-processing-service.ts), gather
fast layer 80ms.

## Contracts

### 1. Token dedup is O(1) per insert — all producers funnel through `addSearchToken`

`packages/utils/search/search-token-builder.ts` tracks dedup keys in a
`WeakMap<SearchTokenList, Set<string>>` seeded on first use. A direct `tokens.push`
after the first `addSearchToken` call bypasses dedup silently — never push token
lists directly; add tokens only via the `add*SearchTokens` helpers.

### 2. Per-app search derivation is memoized — the cache key MUST cover every input

`resolveAppSearchDerived` (search-processing-service.ts) memoizes semantic aliases,
tool-source ids, and `buildAppSearchTokens` output on a content fingerprint
(`buildAppSearchDerivedKey`). **Any new field that feeds catalog resolution or token
building must be added to the key** (exception: values derived from existing key
fields, e.g. `fileName`). A field feeding derivation but missing from the key is a
stale-cache bug: search results silently stop reflecting that field's changes.
User aliases (`setAliases`) flow in via `aliasList` — already keyed.

### 3. Cached arrays are shared references — consumers stay read-only

Cached `searchTokens`/`toolSourceIds` are attached to result items across
keystrokes. `matchFeature` copies tokens it returns (`normalizeSearchToken`) and
must stay non-mutating; no main-process code may write to
`item.meta.extension.searchTokens`. Cache is LRU-bounded
(`APP_SEARCH_DERIVED_CACHE_LIMIT = 512`).

### 4. Runtime index reads belong to the dedicated read worker

Local libSQL's Promise API executes native SQLite synchronously. `Promise.all`
does not move queries off Electron's main thread. Runtime SearchIndexService
receives a SearchIndexReadExecutor owned by SearchEngineCore; FTS, exact/prefix,
ngram/subsequence, counts and commit-visibility reads use that executor. Keep SQL
construction and result semantics in SearchIndexService, not a second worker query
implementation. Writer-side services retain their existing local connection.

The reader opens the same `getSearchDatabaseFilePath()` selected for the writer,
requires an existing regular database and enables `PRAGMA query_only`. It never
migrates, repairs or writes the index. Main still awaits writer readiness before
prewarming the reader; the visibility barrier observes commits on the read
connection. Never hold a long-lived read transaction across searches.

Each read lane owns a bounded queue and one physical native read at a time; since
2026-09-26 there are two lanes over the same worker script and file — `'deferred'`
(file provider, 15s) and `'fast'` (fast-layer providers, 3s) — so a slow file query
never queues an app lookup (see contract 7 below). Pass the
provider AbortSignal through every candidate lookup. A queued abort removes the
work; an active abort rejects its caller but retains the physical slot until the
worker replies or times out. Failure, premature exit, timeout and close settle
every pending caller without replay or a synchronous main-thread fallback. Core
closes both readers from its shutdown finally path, after normal writer drains.

File semantic recall owns a separate `semantic` reader lane over the same worker script and physical read home. The host sends the query vector, model identity and top-K limit; the worker keyset-pages 128 embeddings at a time, rejects invalid/wrong-space vectors and retains only the best chunk per top-K file. Full vector rows and cosine loops never cross to Electron main or renderer. A shared cancellation flag stops page/row work after caller cancellation; retire/shutdown still waits for native reads instead of terminating a libSQL thread. `EmbeddingService.close()` prevents a late query embedding from reopening a reader, and provider shutdown closes this lane. File-vector counts also use the reader.

Canonical keyword mappings are lowercase. Prefix lookup combines escaped literal LIKE with an explicit BINARY keyword range so the provider/keyword index bounds the scan; compute the exclusive Unicode successor rather than appending U+FFFF, which would omit astral continuations. FTS reads use the native `rank` cursor with explicit `rank MATCH 'bm25()'`, preserving BM25 scores without an external SQL sort. Never extend provider deadlines to hide query or queue latency. The existing fast-layer snapshot is published even when empty; deferred SQL, native Spotlight and semantic inference do not hold that snapshot.

### 5. Measure input delivery separately from SQL wall time

Short-lived search sessions use typed IPC by default, not a fresh MessagePort
handshake. Keep the 80ms input debounce and existing ranking policy independent
from that transport decision. SearchIndex duration includes readiness, queueing
and return scheduling; it is not isolated native SQL time. For runtime UI timing,
identify the owned native CoreBox window and its foreground state. Background
timer/animation-frame throttling must not be reported as foreground search latency.

The read-worker integration accepts `TUFF_SEARCH_READ_WORKER_TEST_PATH` for an
isolated build. On macOS canonicalize a temporary build root before electron-vite
build (`/var` can resolve to `/private/var`); relative asset locators otherwise
acquire the wrong parent depth. Use a script file rather than `node --input-type`
for ad-hoc native worker probes, whose child inherits Node loader arguments.

## Verification

```bash
cd packages/utils && npx vitest run                     # 979 tests
cd apps/core-app && npx vitest run src/main/modules/box-tool/addon/apps/
cd apps/core-app && npm run typecheck:node
```

Benchmark shape (throwaway vitest file, see task design.md): old-dedup replica vs
new at 150 apps × 200/400 tokens — measured 2026-08-05: old 1388→6006ms (4.33×,
quadratic), new 34→62ms (1.82×, linear); memoized `processSearchResults` over 150
rows: cold 21.6ms → warm 2.9ms with identical match sets.

## Contracts added 2026-09-26 (task 09-26-corebox-app-search-fast-lane)

Measured on a 9.2GB dev index (276k files, 156 apps): the app FTS lookup cost
0.4–0.5s because `search_index.provider` is UNINDEXED (MATCH scans the whole shared
table before the provider filter), and the single FIFO read worker made every fast
lookup wait behind the previous keystroke's file query. Apps therefore missed the
80ms fast window on every keystroke and arrived as a late batch.

### 6. App search issues no SQL on the keystroke path

`AppProvider.onSearch` recalls from `AppSearchCatalogService`
(`addon/apps/services/app-search-catalog-service.ts`) once it is ready; the SQL path
is the not-yet-loaded fallback only (`APP_SEARCH_MEMORY_PATH_ENABLED` is the kill
switch). The catalog reloads from the database (still the source of truth) on index
commits naming `app-provider`, alias edits (`AppUserAliasService.onChanged`),
icon-pointer repairs, and staleness. A write path that changes an app row without
ending in an index commit must call `searchCatalog.scheduleReload(reason)`; a reload
failure keeps the previous snapshot. The recall funnel mirrors the SQL one
(precise/phrase/prefix → FTS-shaped → n-gram → subsequence, same thresholds) and
`isFuzzySearch` keeps its meaning: no exact/phrase/prefix keyword hit.

### 7. Fast providers read through their own worker lane

`search-core.ts` builds two `SearchIndexReadWorkerClient`s over the same worker
script and database: lane `'deferred'` (15s timeout, the file provider) and lane
`'fast'` (`FAST_READ_LANE_TIMEOUT_MS = 3000`, handed to `priority === 'fast'`
providers through `SearchProviderRegistry` deps `getSearchIndexService(provider)`).
The fast `SearchIndexService` is reader-mode only: never pass it to
`LegacySearchIndexWriter` or the commit visibility barrier, and do not `preloadPinyin`
on it. Request ids carry the lane (`search-index-read-<lane>-<n>`), as does the
retire log.

### 8. 后台索引维护按可信 rowid 定位并向前台让路

`search_index_meta` 持久化 `(provider_id, item_id)` 对应的 `fts_rowid` 和完整检索文档
`document_hash`。可信定位通过 FTS rowid 删除或替换；旧 profile 的缺失定位分页建立，
重复身份、元数据缺失和 FTS 重建必须重新核验，不能按旧 rowid 删除别人的文档。
图标和时间戳变化不重写相同 FTS；title、compact title、keywords、tags、path、content、
type 变化必须更新，单独关键词权重变化仍更新关键词映射。

`waitForIndexMaintenanceIdle()` 在 writer admission、事务和 source mutation lease 之前等待。
执行中的 CoreBox、应用索引页和 DivisionBox 前台会话、近期输入及交互写入都会阻止新片；
后台查询不冒充前台活动。成功、失败、超时、取消和关闭释放本次活动，不能仅靠两秒时间戳
或 `AppTaskGate` 的任务计数判定空闲，也不能用等待超时强行准入。

配置清理每片最多 64 行、每轮最多 16 页，整轮预算 1,500 ms，包含候选枚举、实际事务、
FTS 可见性与发布。扫描缺失、孤儿候选和关键词维护同样分片，没有退出根的无限清理例外。
每片发布后释放权限，再判断前台和取消状态；配置清理与工作队列交替时，只要任一仍有
剩余工作就安排下一轮，空工作队列不能丢掉尚未完成的配置清理。

只在提交与发布成功后推进恢复游标。暂停或重启恢复复核当前规则、额外监控根和观测版本；
权限失败、离线卷及不完整扫描不授权缺失删除。读侧立即过滤已知失效或配置范围外结果，
不等待整轮物理维护。实时 watch、主动重建和隐私清除不无限等待后台 idle。

### 9. Full scans checkpoint per top-level child

`FileProviderFullScanRunService` walks a root child by child and records each child in
`scan_progress` (`FileProviderFullScanCheckpointService`) before moving on; the root's
own files come last, and child records are cleared only after the root's record is
written. A restart resumes past completed children instead of rescanning `~` from
zero. Traversal exclusions apply at listing time, and `DEV_PATHS` are anchored to path
segments (`(^|/)out/`, not `out/`), with `~/go/pkg` and `~/OrbStack` excluded as
home-anchored toolchain caches.

Cold full scans prioritize foreground responsiveness over minimum completion time. After every
persisted chunk, `FileProviderFullScanInsertService` yields at least 250 ms. The fused worker reports
`process.threadCpuUsage()` for each chunk (process CPU is only an old-runtime fallback); if a 35%
single-core duty-cycle budget needs a longer park, that budget wins. A chunk at or above the 250 ms
congestion threshold keeps its proportional capped backoff when that is longer. The scanner's
500-record acknowledgement boundary carries this backpressure upstream, so do not add a second
pending persistence chunk, remove the pause based only on throughput, or change ordered publication
without a new isolated production-like CPU/lag A/B. The AIMD ceiling remains independently measured.

### 10. Result rows obey the context-free directory rules at read time

`fileFilterService.filterSearchItems` (applied to every provider's batch in the gather)
also runs `getReadTimeDirectoryExclusionReason`: unconditional dev names anywhere on the
path (`node_modules`, dot directories), home-anchored toolchain caches and system
locations (minus `~/Library/Mobile Documents`, iCloud Drive). Context-dependent names
(`build`, `dist`, `out`, …) are a walker's decision and are not judged here. This is
what hides rows indexed under an older rule set while the budgeted cleanup (contract 8)
retires them; do not "fix" a stale-row sighting by widening the cleanup budget.

Generated Python dependency/cache directory names (`uvcache`, `__pycache__`, `site-packages`) are
unconditional dev exclusions across traversal, watcher admission, writes, and read-time filtering.
Ordinary context-dependent names such as `build` keep the sibling project-marker rule.

### 11. File fuzzy recall is staged after exact/index recall

`FileProviderSearchResultService` runs exact keyword, short prefix and FTS in parallel. It does not run `lookupBySubsequence` or n-gram aggregation beside every ordinary query: on a 150,000-file / 4,036,303-keyword fixture that shape produced 1.2 s warm P95. Only when those primary sources return no candidate does it try up to two selective numeric/letter FTS tokens, then bounded n-gram recall. At most 120 admitted candidates reach the in-process fzf-style filename/path scorer.

Zero-result diagnostics never count the FTS or meta table on the request path. A diagnostic log may include provider and query length, but no follow-up read may delay the empty result.

Regression and benchmark contract: exact/prefix stays ahead of fuzzy; filename beats path-only; typo/non-consecutive recall preserves the intended Top-K. The 150,000-row / 4,036,303-keyword warm probe must remain below the CoreBox 80 ms window even with zero `sqlite_stat1` rows (2026-09-29 baseline: median 1.36 ms, P95 32.20 ms, max 37.03 ms).

## Scenario: Direct path actions lead their search batch

### 1. Scope / Trigger

`SystemActionsProvider` recognizes an existing complete path, including `~`, spaces, file URLs, and copied file inputs. This is a contextual action, not a file-index search or a context-free frequent recommendation.

### 2. Signatures

- `getDirectoryTerminals(deps?)` returns `{ default, installed, all }`; production discovery is process-cached and primed from provider startup.
- `openDirectoryInTerminal(terminal, directory, deps?)` confirms a directory and reports real launcher acquisition or failure.
- Path rows carry `meta.extension.pathAction = { kind, ordinal, path, terminalId? }` and originate from `system-actions-provider` with source type `system`.

### 3. Contracts

- Whole paths are tried before token fragments. Missing paths produce no open action; plain files produce a file-manager reveal, never a terminal cwd.
- Within one arriving batch, directory order is default terminal, other installed terminals, Finder/file manager, then ordinary results and existing index actions. Only the trusted system source can claim the path rank band; pinned items retain their partition.
- macOS offers fixed terminal identities only when their bundles declare folder opening; default is system Terminal unless a live configured terminal is selected. LaunchServices receives the directory as one argv entry. Windows terminal aliases are offered only when present; Windows/Linux launches await spawn acknowledgment and observe asynchronous errors.
- No shell interpolation or per-keystroke application scan. Executing rechecks directory/terminal presence. One-shot path actions do not rebuild into the empty-state frequent list.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

Missing directory, non-directory cwd, missing terminal, or failed acquisition → refused action and no accepted usage count. A forged plugin `pathAction` → normal rank, not the system band.

If path validation or terminal discovery misses the first publication, the renderer appends these unpinned actions below existing rows even with a higher score. The append-only consumer contract keeps the current selection stable; the path rank band does not guarantee first-row placement across batches.

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

Good: a directory named `中文 path; $literal` opens with that exact cwd. Base: only the system terminal is installed, so no duplicate terminal row is emitted. Bad: offering a nonexistent `wt.exe` or returning success before its asynchronous spawn error.

### 6. Tests Required

Directory/provider/sorter regressions cover spaced/Unicode paths, file versus directory, missing/removed targets, terminal argv/cwd, pin precedence, and forged metadata. Real CoreBox Enter must create a shell whose OS cwd matches the target; tests alone do not prove it.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong: `spawn('sh', ['-c', 'cd ' + path])`. Correct: an inventory-owned launcher with a literal argv directory or process `cwd`, then observed launcher acquisition.
